# PicTur Backend

Flask API Server for the Turtle Identification System.

## Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (copy from `env.template`):

```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item env.template .env

# On Linux/Mac
cp env.template .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
# Server Port (default: 5000)
PORT=5000

# Flask Debug Mode
FLASK_DEBUG=true

# JWT Secret - MUST match the JWT_SECRET in auth-backend/.env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production
```

**Important:** The `JWT_SECRET` must match the `JWT_SECRET` in `auth-backend/.env` so that the Flask backend can verify JWT tokens from the auth-backend.

## Starting the Server

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server runs by default on `http://localhost:5000`.

  - Query parameter: `path=<encoded_image_path>`

## Data Structure

The backend uses the following directory structure:

```
backend/
├── data/                                       # Main data directory
│   ├── Review_Queue/                           # Community uploads (waiting for review)
│   ├── Community_Uploads/                      # Saved community uploads
│   └── [Location]/ or [State]/[Location]/      # Official turtle data
│       └── [TurtleID]/                         # Bio ID, e.g. F042 (or {bio_id}_{primary_id} once renamed)
│           ├── plastron/                       # Plastron reference image + .pt tensor
│           │   ├── Old References/             # Archived plastron masters from past replacements
│           │   └── Other Plastrons/            # Extra plastron observations (non-reference)
│           └── carapace/                       # Carapace reference image + .pt tensor
│               ├── Old References/             # Archived carapace masters from past replacements
│               └── Other Carapaces/            # Extra carapace observations (non-reference)
├── app.py                                      # Flask API Server
├── turtle_manager.py                           # Main logic for turtle management
├── turtles/image_processing.py                 # SuperPoint/LightGlue matching
└── routes/                                     # API route modules
```

Each turtle gets the full dual-reference tree regardless of which photo types it currently has — empty subdirs stay empty until manually populated. Legacy `ref_data/` directories from before the dual-reference refactor are migrated to `plastron/` by `ingest_rebuild_folder.py`; production data may still be pre-migration. Some turtles also have an `additional_images/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` tree at the turtle root for microhabitat/condition photos that are not SuperPoint references.

## Important Notes

- On startup, the system scans turtle reference `.pt` tensors and warms the in-memory matcher cache.
- Community uploads are saved in `data/Review_Queue/` and wait for admin review.
- Admin uploads are processed immediately and the top 5 matches are returned.

## Clearing Uploaded Data

To clear all uploaded data (Review Queue, Community Uploads, temporary files):

```bash
python clear_uploads.py
```

This will:

- Delete all items in the Review Queue
- Delete all Community Uploads
- Clear temporary uploaded files

**Note:** This does NOT delete:

- Official turtle data (State/Location folders)
- Deprecated VLAD/FAISS fallback indexes and vocabulary
- Existing reference tensors/models

To clear only the Review Queue:

```bash
python clear_uploads.py --review-only
```

## Maintenance Scripts

Two operational scripts live alongside the Flask app for one-off migrations and daily drift correction. Both default to **dry-run mode** — they print a full manifest of what they *would* do and exit without changing anything on disk. Pass `--apply` to actually execute the changes.

Both scripts treat Google Sheets as **read-only** — they never edit the production spreadsheets.

### `backfill_folder_names.py` — sync folder names to Sheets

Keeps turtle folder names in sync with the current state of the research + community spreadsheets. Three jobs in one pass:

1. Adds `_{primary_id}` to bio-ID-only folders once the sheet has assigned a primary key (`F017/` → `F017_T177.../`).
2. Rehomes misplaced `T177...`-only folders that landed in a state root instead of a location directory (production bug), giving them their combined `{bio_id}_{primary_id}` name in the correct `state/location/`.
3. Detects bio-ID changes (juvenile → adult, misgender corrections) on already-renamed folders and renames both the folder and its internal reference files.

Idempotent. Safe to run daily — intended to be tied into the Sheets-backup chronodrop once `main` is merged.

```bash
# Dry run: see what would change
docker compose exec backend python backfill_folder_names.py

# Apply the changes
docker compose exec backend python backfill_folder_names.py --apply
```

The `--apply` flag is what actually writes to disk. Without it, you see a manifest and no files are touched. Exit code is `1` if any errors were reported, `0` otherwise.

### `ingest_rebuild_folder.py` — ingest carapaces + new turtles

Walks a host-side "Rebuild Ingest" folder tree and pushes its contents into the backend data directory. Expected layout:

```
<ingest root>/
  Lawrence/
    F017 Plastron.jpg
    F017 Plastron 2.jpg
    F017 Carapace.jpg
    F999 Carapace.jpg
  North Topeka/
    ...
```

Each top-level folder name must match a key in `DRIVE_LOCATION_TO_BACKEND_PATH` (`turtle_manager.py`).

**Symmetric folder layout.** Every turtle the script touches receives the full dual-reference tree, regardless of which photo types this ingest provides:

```
<turtle_id>/
  plastron/
    Old References/
    Other Plastrons/
  carapace/
    Old References/
    Other Carapaces/
```

Empty subdirs stay empty until a manual upload fills them. Plastron-only and carapace-only ingests therefore produce the same shape as combined ones — so a turtle with only a carapace today is ready to receive a plastron later without any folder-creation logic.

**Per bio-ID group:**

- **Existing turtle:** migrates legacy `ref_data/` → `plastron/` when present (moves all files including any pre-existing `.pt`), removes empty `loose_images/`, files new plastrons into `plastron/Other Plastrons/`, and places a carapace reference (or routes extras to `carapace/Other Carapaces/`) as needed.
- **Unknown turtle:** creates a bio-id-named folder with the full subdir tree, then places whatever references the ingest provides.

**Feature extraction (`.pt` files) runs inline by default.** Every newly-placed reference image gets its sibling `.pt` before the script exits — so when the backend comes back up, `refresh_database_index()` just *indexes* the existing `.pt`s and pushes both caches to VRAM (it does **not** generate features itself, despite older docstrings claiming otherwise). Pass `--no-extract` to skip extraction for filesystem-only smoke tests, but be aware those references will stay invisible to matching until you re-run with extraction or upload them via the admin UI.

Turtles not yet in the sheets stay bio-id-only named. They pick up their `primary_id` later when someone matches against them through the normal admin/community upload flow, at which point `backfill_folder_names.py` will rename the folder on its next run.

**Running from a Windows host:** mount the host-side ingest folder into the backend container with a one-off `docker compose run`. The backend should be **stopped first** when running `--apply` with extraction — both processes load SuperPoint, doubling VRAM use, which can OOM tighter GPUs.

```bash
# Dry run — preview what would be written to /app/data
docker compose run --rm \
    -v "C:/Users/gking/Desktop/Rebuild Ingest:/ingest:ro" \
    backend python ingest_rebuild_folder.py --ingest-path /ingest

# Apply with inline keypoint extraction (recommended path)
docker compose stop backend
docker compose run --rm \
    -v "C:/Users/gking/Desktop/Rebuild Ingest:/ingest:ro" \
    backend python ingest_rebuild_folder.py --ingest-path /ingest --apply
docker compose start backend

# Apply without extraction — fast filesystem-only smoke test
docker compose run --rm \
    -v "C:/Users/gking/Desktop/Rebuild Ingest:/ingest:ro" \
    backend python ingest_rebuild_folder.py --ingest-path /ingest --apply --no-extract
```

On Linux/macOS, replace the host path with your equivalent (e.g. `-v "$HOME/rebuild_ingest:/ingest:ro"`).

**Suggested order** when running both scripts for the first time on a production machine:

1. `docker compose stop backend` — free GPU memory for the ingest run.
2. `ingest_rebuild_folder.py --apply` — drops images into the dual-reference layout and extracts `.pt` files inline.
3. `backfill_folder_names.py --apply` — renames the folders to `{bio_id}_{primary_id}`.
4. `docker compose start backend` — `refresh_database_index()` indexes the new `.pt` files and loads both VRAM caches.

Step 3 can be re-run any time afterwards to catch new primary-key assignments or bio-ID changes (it's idempotent and wired into the nightly chronodrop). If you skipped extraction in step 2, you'll need to re-run step 2 (or upload references through the admin UI) before any of those turtles can match.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5000 is already in use, change the port in your `.env` file:

```env
PORT=5001
```

Or set it as an environment variable before starting:

```bash
PORT=5001 python app.py
```

### Environment Configuration

The backend uses a separate `.env` file that is completely independent from `auth-backend/.env`. The only shared configuration is `JWT_SECRET`, which must match between both backends for authentication to work.

- `backend/.env` - Flask backend configuration (PORT, FLASK_DEBUG, JWT_SECRET)
- `auth-backend/.env` - Auth backend configuration (PORT, JWT_SECRET, etc.)

These are kept separate to avoid configuration conflicts.

### Missing Dependencies

Make sure all packages are installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker and CUDA

The default `backend/Dockerfile` is CPU-focused (`python:3.11-slim`) and works without NVIDIA runtime.
If you want GPU acceleration in Docker, use `backend/Dockerfile.cuda` with NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
From repo root:

```powershell
# auto GPU->CPU fallback launcher (Windows/PowerShell)
./scripts/docker-up.ps1
```

```bash
# auto GPU->CPU fallback launcher (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x ./scripts/docker-up.sh
./scripts/docker-up.sh

# explicit GPU compose override
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up --build
```

### 500 Error on Photo Upload (POST /api/upload)

If the server returns **500** when uploading a photo from the frontend, the cause is often a **missing or empty `data/` folder** or stale optional legacy artifacts. The SuperPoint/LightGlue path does not require VLAD/FAISS.

**Legacy note:**  
Older VLAD/FAISS experiments could fail with mismatched `vlad_vocab.pkl` and `turtles.index` files. Those files are now deprecated compatibility artifacts and are not part of the default runtime match path.

**Typical causes:**

1. **No or empty `backend/data/`**  
   The backend expects turtle reference data under `backend/data/` in the structure `data/<Location>/.../<TurtleID>/plastron/` (and optionally `/carapace/`) with `.jpg/.jpeg/.png` plus generated `.pt` tensors. Pre-migration turtles may still use the legacy `ref_data/` layout, which is read in compatibility mode. If data is empty, uploads still work but return no matches.

2. **Corrupted tensors / unreadable images**  
   If `.pt` files are stale or corrupted, matching may fail for specific turtles. Rebuilding tensors from source images resolves this.

3. **Deprecated legacy artifacts mixed in**  
   If experimenting with VLAD/FAISS fallback files, keep them consistent or delete them as a set.

**What to do:**

- **Option A – Use the same data as you:**  
  Copy your `backend/data/` to your colleague’s machine in the same relative path. Then restart the backend.

- **Option B – Empty setup (no matches):**  
  Ensure `backend/data/` exists (e.g. `backend/data/Review_Queue`, `backend/data/Community_Uploads` are created on first run; after a full reset, folder structure is recreated from admin and community sheet names). With the current code, an empty `data/` no longer causes 500; uploads succeed and return **no matches** until reference data (and index) are added. If you had a 500 before, delete **all** index/vocab files in `backend/turtles/` (see Option C) so no stale unfitted vocab remains.

- **Option C – Clear deprecated fallback artifacts together:**  
  If you are experimenting with VLAD/FAISS fallback files in `backend/turtles/` (`vlad_vocab.pkl`, `turtles.index`, `metadata.pkl`, `global_vlad_array.npy`, `trained_kmeans_vocabulary.pkl`), remove them together when resetting. Use `python reset_complete_backend.py` to clean data plus these artifacts.

- **See the real error:**  
  In the backend terminal, the exception and traceback are printed when a 500 occurs. The API response body may also include an `error` (and in debug mode `details`) field with the message. Check both to confirm the cause.

## Google Sheets API Integration

The backend supports integration with Google Sheets for turtle data management. This allows admins to sync turtle data directly to Google Sheets when approving matches or creating new turtles.

### Prerequisites

1. A Google Cloud Project
2. A Google Sheets spreadsheet with the turtle data
3. Service Account credentials

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

#### Step 2: Create a Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
3. Fill in the service account details:
   - Name: `turtle-sheets-service` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: `Service account for PicTur Google Sheets integration`
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Skip the optional steps and click "Done"

#### Step 3: Create and Download Service Account Key

1. Click on the service account you just created
2. Go to the "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
4. Select "JSON" format
5. Click "Create" - this will download a JSON file
6. Save this file securely (e.g., `backend/credentials/google-sheets-credentials.json`)

#### Step 4: Share Google Sheet with Service Account

1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet
2. Click the "Share" button
3. Add the service account email (found in the JSON file as `client_email`)
4. Give it "Editor" permissions
5. Click "Send"

#### Step 5: Get Spreadsheet ID

1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet
2. Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit`
3. Copy the `SPREADSHEET_ID` part

#### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following variables to your `backend/.env` file:

```env
# Google Sheets API Configuration
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your-spreadsheet-id-here
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./credentials/google-sheets-credentials.json
```

Replace `your-spreadsheet-id-here` with your actual spreadsheet ID and update the credentials path if you saved the JSON file in a different location.

#### Step 7: Install Dependencies

The Google Sheets API dependencies are already included in `requirements.txt`. If you haven't installed them yet:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:

- `google-api-python-client`
- `google-auth`
- `google-auth-oauthlib`
- `google-auth-httplib2`

#### Step 8: Verify Setup

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Check the console output - you should see no errors related to Google Sheets
3. If there are errors, check:
   - The credentials file path is correct
   - The spreadsheet ID is correct
   - The service account has access to the spreadsheet
   - The Google Sheets API is enabled

### Google Sheets Structure

The Google Sheets spreadsheet should have:

1. **Multiple sheets (tabs)**: One sheet per region/state
   - Example: "Kansas", "Nebraska", etc.

2. **Header row (Row 1)**: Contains column headers:
   - Transmitter ID
   - ID (Primary ID - this is the key field)
   - ID2 (random sequence)
   - Pit?
   - Pic in 2024 Archive?
   - Adopted?
   - iButton?
   - DNA Extracted?
   - Date 1st found
   - Species
   - Name
   - Sex
   - iButton Last set
   - Dates refound
   - General Location
   - Location
   - Notes
   - Transmitter put on by
   - Transmitter On Date
   - Transmitter type
   - Transmitter lifespan
   - Radio Replace Date
   - OLD Frequencies

3. **Data rows**: Each row represents one turtle

### Important Notes

- **Column headers must match exactly** (case-sensitive)
- **The "ID" column is the primary key** - it should be unique across all sheets
- **Sheet names should match state names** (e.g., "Kansas", "Nebraska")
- The system automatically finds columns by header name, so column order can change
- New columns can be added - just make sure the header name matches the expected format

### Post-confirmation automation (relabeling and community spreadsheet)

Once the turtle team confirms an upload (match to existing turtle or new turtle), the backend automates:

1. **Relabeling photos and records**
   - **Match:** The uploaded image is copied into the confirmed turtle’s folder (`data/<location>/<turtle_id>/loose_images/`) with a timestamped filename (e.g. `Obs_<timestamp>_<original>.jpg`). The review packet is then removed. The correct turtle ID is thus reflected by the folder and filename.
   - **New turtle:** The image is processed into a new turtle folder under the chosen location/sheet.
   - Research Google Sheet is updated by the admin (or frontend) before or during confirm; the backend does not change sheet data for matches beyond optional community sync.

2. **Community-facing spreadsheet (required)**
   - Community uploads are always synced to a **separate** community spreadsheet. Set `GOOGLE_SHEETS_COMMUNITY_SPREADSHEET_ID` in `.env` (see `env.template`). Use the same service account and share the community spreadsheet with it (Editor).
   - **Match to existing turtle:** The confirmed row is synced from the research spreadsheet to the community spreadsheet (research remains the source of truth for that turtle).
   - **New turtle from community upload:** The turtle is created **only** in the community spreadsheet, not in the research spreadsheet. So community-only turtles exist only in the community sheet.
   - If the community spreadsheet is not configured or sync fails, the approval request fails with a 503 and a clear error message.

### Google Sheets API Endpoints

- `GET /api/sheets/turtle/<primary_id>` - Get turtle data from Google Sheets (Admin only)
- `POST /api/sheets/turtle` - Create new turtle data in Google Sheets (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/sheets/turtle/<primary_id>` - Update turtle data in Google Sheets (Admin only)
- `GET /api/sheets/sheets` - List all available sheets (Admin only)

### Troubleshooting Google Sheets

#### Error: "Google Sheets service not configured"

- Check that `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID` and `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` are set in `.env`
- Verify the credentials file exists at the specified path

#### Error: "Failed to authenticate with Google Sheets"

- Check that the credentials JSON file is valid
- Verify the service account email has access to the spreadsheet
- Make sure the Google Sheets API is enabled in your Google Cloud project

#### Error: "Turtle not found in Google Sheets"

- Verify the turtle's Primary ID exists in the spreadsheet
- Check that you're looking in the correct sheet (state/region)
- Ensure the "ID" column header is exactly "ID" (case-sensitive)

#### Error: "Failed to create/update turtle data"

- Check that the service account has "Editor" permissions on the spreadsheet
- Verify the sheet name matches the state name
- Check that all required columns exist in the header row

### Backup (Google Sheets export)

The backend can export all sheets from both the admin and community spreadsheets to CSV (and JSON) for backup and history. See **docs/BACKUP.md** for the full strategy (where to store backups, Docker, retention, restore).

- **Run manually** (from `backend` directory):
  ```bash
  python -m backup.run
  ```
- **Output:** `BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR/sheets/YYYY-MM-DD/` with one CSV per sheet (`admin_SheetName.csv`, `community_SheetName.csv`) and optional `admin.json` / `community.json`. Each run **fills missing Primary IDs** in the live spreadsheets (when biology **ID** is set) before writing files, so nightly cron backups stay aligned with the app without a container restart.
- **Env:** `BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR` (default: `./backups`). With Docker, the compose file mounts `./backups` on the host to `/app/backups` so backups are stored outside the container.
- **On the server / cron:** Use **`scripts/daily-backup.sh`** to export Sheets **and** copy `data/` (images) from the Docker volume onto the host under `backups/data/YYYY-MM-DD/`, or run `docker compose exec -T backend python -m backup.run` for Sheets only. `daily-backup.sh` sets **`BACKUP_DATE`** from the host so `sheets/` and `data/` use the same calendar day as the server clock. Schedule with **`crontab -e`** (do not paste cron lines into a normal shell—the leading `0 3 * * *` is not a command). Examples: **docs/BACKUP.md**.
