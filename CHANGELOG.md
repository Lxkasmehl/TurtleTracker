# Changelog

All notable changes to TurtleTracker will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **General Location**: Admin turtle forms use a state-dependent dropdown and add-new flow (replacing free text), backed by a shared catalog with sheet-specific auto-fill (e.g. `NebraskaCPBS`, `IowaHawkeye`); new sheets get matching Google Sheets validation.
- **Backup (Google Sheets)**: Export admin and community spreadsheets to CSV and JSON for backup and history. Run `python -m backup.run` from backend; output under `BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR/sheets/YYYY-MM-DD/` (one CSV per sheet plus optional JSON per spreadsheet). `BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR` configurable via env (default `./backups`). Docker Compose mounts `./backups` on the host so backups survive container/volume removal. Strategy and retention in `docs/BACKUP.md`; backend README and env.template updated. `.gitignore` excludes `backups/`. `.env.docker.example` documents `GOOGLE_SHEETS_COMMUNITY_SPREADSHEET_ID` for Docker.

### Fixed
- **General location catalog**: Normalization no longer injects placeholder states into existing `general_locations.json`; POST add-location won't persist fake keys; first-run seed matches repo defaults.
- **Sheets validation**: `POST /api/general-locations` applies dropdown rules via the real Sheets client (fixes silent “0 tabs” sync); research turtle create/update re-syncs the affected tab.

### Changed
- **Admin turtle form**: Sheet/location changes clear General Location, re-apply defaults, and remount the Select to avoid stale Mantine labels.
- **Home (staff upload)**: Match-scope Select always reflects a valid option (no empty control when the stored value is missing from loaded data).
- **Upload instructions**: Clearer modal layout and plastron checklist; lab vs field photo note; reminder view closable without scroll/checkbox; simpler header with “View instructions”.
- **CI (Playwright E2E)**: Smoke run, parallel `--shard` matrix on `tests/e2e`, shared `e2e-playwright-prepare` action, `e2e-success` gate, HTML reports per smoke/shard (browser matrix unchanged).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Location hierarchy (sheet + location)**: New turtles and community uploads use a two-level selection (e.g. sheet Kansas → location Wichita). Backend paths: `data/<sheet>/<location>/<turtle_id>/`. New locations can be added under an existing sheet without a new Google Sheet tab. Resolves #96.
- **Post-confirmation automation**: After confirming an upload (match or new turtle), the backend relabels photos with the confirmed turtle ID and syncs to a community-facing Google Spreadsheet. Configure `GOOGLE_SHEETS_COMMUNITY_SPREADSHEET_ID` in backend `.env`. Resolves #73.
- **Email verification & password policy**: New users (email/password) must verify their email via signup link (`POST /auth/verify-email`, `POST /auth/resend-verification`). Google OAuth users count as verified; admin routes require verified email. Registration and change-password enforce policy via `validatePassword`; new endpoint `POST /auth/change-password` (authenticated). Shared email helpers for verification, admin promotion, and invitations; sender configurable via `SMTP_FROM`.
- **Docker**: Frontend port configurable via `FRONTEND_PORT` (default 80). For port 80 conflicts use `FRONTEND_PORT=8080` and `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080`. See `.env.docker.example`.
- **Review queue & community sheets**: Badges for "Admin upload" vs "Community upload"; sheet/location dropdown respects `sheetSource`. API: `GET /api/sheets/community-sheets`; sheets/turtle endpoints accept `target_spreadsheet: 'community'`. Option "+ Create New Sheet" for community turtles (creates tab and `data/Community_Uploads/<name>`). Backend layout: `data/<admin sheet>`, `data/Community_Uploads/<community sheet>`.
- **Community turtle → admin**: When matching a community turtle to the research spreadsheet, flow selects admin sheet + location, creates turtle row, moves folder to `data/<State>/<Location>/`, and removes from community sheet. Match search includes selected location, all community turtles, and incidental finds.
- **Flash-drive ingest**: Configurable ingest routing maps drive folder names to backend destinations (`State/Location`) without renaming source folders. Supports flat and hierarchical layouts; explicit state-level folder handling for `data/<State>/...` imports.
- **Match scope**: With a location selected, match search runs against that location plus all Community_Uploads and Incidental_Finds. Home page options: "Community Turtles only" (Community_Uploads only) or "All locations" (everything). Helper text describes the three scope behaviors.

### Changed

- **Auth**: DB migration adds `email_verified` / `email_verified_at`; existing users treated as verified. JWT and `/auth/me` include `email_verified`. E2E test setup marks test users verified.
- **Intake survey**: "Health Status" field with free-text and optional tooltip (mucous, eyes, shell, dehydration, mites, etc.); stored in Sheets when column exists.
- **Turtle forms & locations**: ID field always read-only (create and edit); copy clarifies IDs may not be unique across sheets. General Location required for admin turtles; paths `data/State/Location/PrimaryID`. `get_all_locations()` includes state-level folders so sheet-based states appear in dropdowns. Review queue: admin `new_location` = Sheet/general_location; community = single sheet in community spreadsheet.
- **Create New Turtle / Sheet–Location**: Sheet/Location dropdown shows only top-level states (e.g. Kansas); Kansas sublocations (e.g. Kansas/Wichita) and system folders (Community_Uploads, Review_Queue, Incidental_Finds) are no longer selectable. In backend-location mode, Kansas expands to location entries; selecting `Kansas/<location>` keeps Sheets tab at state level while targeting backend path at location level. `LOCATION_SYSTEM_FOLDERS` and `SYSTEM_FOLDERS` include Incidental_Finds.
- **Admin upload match scope**: Home page "Which location to test against?" supports location-level options in `State/Location` format; Kansas expands to locations, other states remain state-level.
- **CI (Playwright)**: E2E runs smoke tests (auth, navigation, upload) first, then remaining E2E; Playwright report artifact uploaded only on failure.

### Fixed

- **Google Sheets**: Single RLock for all Sheets API use and reinit to avoid concurrent SSL errors and segfaults (e.g. DECRYPTION_FAILED_OR_BAD_RECORD_MAC, exit 139).
- **Create New Turtle E2E**: ID field now populates on WebKit/Firefox (request biology ID when sex selected; test mocks `/api/locations` and waits for generate-id).
- **E2E flakiness**: Sex dropdown scoped to listbox; longer timeout for "From this upload"; review queue content and "No pending reviews" timeouts (WebKit, Mobile Safari).
- **Community sheet creation**: "Create New Sheet" for community turtles no longer creates the tab in the research spreadsheet; generate-id and update-turtle accept `target_spreadsheet`; frontend passes it when `sheetSource` is community.
- **E2E and test setup**: Test user seed scripts always update password and role for existing users so E2E credentials work regardless of prior state. Playwright webServer uses `path`/`cwd` and `127.0.0.1`; Vite `strictPort: true`. Login fixtures use `noWaitAfter`, detect login errors, and throw clear messages suggesting `npm run test:setup`. Selectors: `getByRole('textbox')` for Sheet/Location, regex for General Location; ID field always disabled; sheet option selection uses exact match (Kansas vs Kansas/Wichita).
- **New turtle create UX**: In-progress/success notification updates and short post-success delay before redirect so completion feedback remains visible. Removed duplicate primary-ID generation path in frontend create/confirm flow to reduce round-trips.

### Testing

- **E2E**: Review queue upload-source badges (Admin vs Community), community-turtle-move-to-admin flow (`data-testid` on badges). Create New Turtle duplicate-name tests mock `/api/locations` and fill General Location. Home page match-scope helper text and sheet dropdown (top-level states only, no sublocations/system folders). admin-community-to-admin and Create New Turtle support both Mantine Select and native `<select>` for Sheet/Location.
- **Integration**: Tests for `GET /api/locations` and for `POST /api/sheets/generate-id` with `target_spreadsheet` (research/community).
