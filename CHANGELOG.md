## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Location selection (sheet + location)**: Two-level location hierarchy for new turtles and community uploads. Users select a spreadsheet/sheet (e.g. Kansas, Nebraska) and then a location folder (e.g. Wichita, Lawrence). Backend paths are now `data/<sheet>/<location>/<turtle_id>/` instead of `data/<sheet>/<turtle_id>/`. New locations can be added under an existing sheet without creating a new Google Sheet tab. API `GET /api/locations` returns backend location paths (State/Location) for dropdowns. Resolves #96.
- **Post-confirmation automation**: After the turtle team confirms an upload (match or new turtle), the backend now (1) relabels photos/records with the confirmed turtle ID (e.g. copies images into the turtle folder with timestamped filenames) and (2) syncs confirmed data to a **community-facing Google Spreadsheet** (separate from the research spreadsheet). Set `GOOGLE_SHEETS_COMMUNITY_SPREADSHEET_ID` in backend `.env`; community spreadsheet is required for community-upload confirmations. Resolves #73.
- **Docker**: Configurable frontend host port via `FRONTEND_PORT` in `.env` (default 80). When port 80 is in use, set `FRONTEND_PORT=8080` and `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080` so auth redirects work correctly. See `.env.docker.example` and comments in `docker-compose.yml`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27

First release of TurtleTracker: a community-driven web platform for turtle population monitoring using image-based identification.

### Added

- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and Google OAuth via auth backend (Node.js/Express). JWT-based sessions and role-based access (admin vs community).
- **Photo upload and matching**: Admins and community users can upload turtle photos; system returns top matches. Community uploads go to a review queue for admin approval.
- **Admin features**: Review queue for community uploads with suggested matches; admin can confirm match or create new turtle. Photo upload with immediate top-5 match selection.
- **Turtle records / data**: Turtle data management with optional Google Sheets integration (service account); auto-generated biology IDs and configurable fields.
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) app with Mantine UI, Tailwind, Leaflet maps; configured for auth and turtle API backends.
- **Backend**: Flask API (Python) for photo processing and matching; auth backend for user and session management.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose setup for running frontend, auth-backend, and backend together; persistent volumes for DB, uploads, and review state.
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests (Docker-based) and backend integration tests (pytest); CI workflows for main/develop.
- **Documentation**: README with quick start (Docker and local), functionality overview, and versioning guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
- Version control and release process: `CHANGELOG.md`, version in `frontend/package.json`, and guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
