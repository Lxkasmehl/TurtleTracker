# Changelog

All notable changes to TurtleTracker will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Email verification**: New users (email/password registration) must verify their email via a link sent on signup. Auth backend supports `email_verified` / `email_verified_at` on users, an `email_verifications` table for tokens, and endpoints `POST /auth/verify-email` and `POST /auth/resend-verification`. Google OAuth users are treated as verified. Admin-only routes (promote-to-admin, users list) require a verified email via `requireEmailVerified` middleware.
- **Password policy**: Registration and change-password enforce a password policy via `validatePassword`. New endpoint `POST /auth/change-password` (authenticated) to update password with the same policy.
- **Email service**: Verification emails via `sendVerificationEmail`; shared helpers `wrapEmailHtml` and `sendMailSafe`; admin promotion and invitation emails refactored to use them. No-reply sender configurable via `SMTP_FROM`.
- **Docker**: Configurable frontend host port via `FRONTEND_PORT` in `.env` (default 80). When port 80 is in use, set `FRONTEND_PORT=8080` and `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080` so auth redirects work correctly. See `.env.docker.example` and comments in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Changed

- **Auth backend**: Database migration adds `email_verified` and `email_verified_at` to existing users (treated as verified). SQLite-style wrapper supports `email_verifications` table and DELETE on verification tokens. JWT and `/auth/me` include `email_verified`. Admin and auth middleware use Express `Request` with `AuthRequest` cast where needed.
- **Test setup**: `seed-test-users` and `test-setup` scripts set test users to email-verified so E2E login flows land on the app as expected.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27

First release of TurtleTracker: a community-driven web platform for turtle population monitoring using image-based identification.

### Added

- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and Google OAuth via auth backend (Node.js/Express). JWT-based sessions and role-based access (admin vs community).
- **Photo upload and matching**: Admins and community users can upload turtle photos; system returns top matches. Community uploads go to a review queue for admin approval.
- **Admin features**: Review queue for community uploads with suggested matches; admin can confirm match or create new turtle. Photo upload with immediate top-5 match selection.
- **Turtle records / data**: Turtle data management with optional Google Sheets integration (service account); auto-generated biology IDs and configurable fields.
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) app with Mantine UI, Tailwind, Leaflet maps; configured for auth and turtle API backends.
- **Backend**: Flask API (Python) for photo processing and matching; auth backend for user and session management.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose setup for running frontend, auth-backend, and backend together; persistent volumes for DB, uploads, and review state.
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests (Docker-based) and backend integration tests (pytest); CI workflows for main/develop.
- **Documentation**: README with quick start (Docker and local), functionality overview, and versioning guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
- Version control and release process: `CHANGELOG.md`, version in `frontend/package.json`, and guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
