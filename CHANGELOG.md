# Changelog

All notable changes to PicTur will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Folder-name backfill quarantined from the daily chronodrop**: `scripts/daily-backup.sh` no longer invokes `backfill_folder_names.py --apply`. The backfill is now a manual operator command. Run it by hand with `docker compose exec backend python backfill_folder_names.py [--apply]`, followed by a manual `docker compose restart backend` if `--apply` reports changes. The wrapper's header documents the workflow; the backfill block is preserved in commented form for trivial revert.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-30 — SuperPoint + LightGlue matching, dual plastron/carapace references, per-turtle folder layout, admin photo workflow rewrite

Major version bump. The Superpoint-Implementation branch reaches parity with
its design goals and merges back to main. The matching pipeline is fully
replaced (VLAD/FAISS → SuperPoint + LightGlue), every turtle now supports
two independent references (plastron + carapace) backed by dual VRAM caches,
the on-disk folder layout migrates to a per-turtle, per-photo-type tree
(`{state}/{location}/{turtle_id}/{plastron,carapace,additional_images,...}`),
and the admin photo workflow gets a full rewrite (staged uploads, soft
delete with restore, per-directory manifest tags, replace-reference flow,
flag → release-page chain, scratchpad role-grouped headers, expanded photo
categories). Folder layout and matcher are non-backward-compatible with
1.x — operators must run `ingest_rebuild_folder.py --apply` followed by
`backfill_folder_names.py --apply` against a 1.x data dir before starting
a 2.0.0 backend, and matching always uses the new `.pt` SuperPoint tensors
rather than the legacy VLAD index.

### Added

- **SuperPoint + LightGlue matching pipeline**: Replaces the legacy VLAD / FAISS search. `turtles/image_processing.py` defines a `TurtleDeepMatcher` singleton (`brain`) that pre-loads all reference `.pt` feature tensors into GPU VRAM (or CPU RAM when no GPU) at startup. Extracts 4-rotation SuperPoint features for queries once, reuses them across all fallback searches. Switchable device mode via `brain.set_device()`. Legacy `search_utils.py` kept as a no-op compatibility module.
- **Carapace support (dual matching paths)**: Every turtle can have two independent reference images — plastron (belly) and carapace (top of shell) — with separate VRAM caches (`vram_cache_plastron` / `vram_cache_carapace`). `match_against_cache(photo_type=...)` selects the right cache, and `refresh_database_index()` scans both `plastron/` and `carapace/` subfolders. Admin uploads are always plastron; community uploads arrive as `unclassified` and are classified in the review queue with Plastron / Carapace / Trash buttons before any matching runs.
- **Per-turtle folder structure with Old References / Other archives**: New turtle folders get `plastron/`, `plastron/Old References/`, `plastron/Other Plastrons/`, `carapace/`, `carapace/Old References/`, `carapace/Other Carapaces/` created up front. Legacy `ref_data/` and `loose_images/` still readable via fallback. Reference replacement archives the previous master to `Old References/` atomically; non-reference plastron/carapace images land in the corresponding `Other …/` folder instead of the generic `additional_images/` bucket.
- **Sheets browser photo management (replaces upload direct-add)**: The Google Sheets Browser turtle detail panel now hosts all turtle-specific photo operations. New red **Plastron** and **Carapace** buttons open a modal asking whether to replace the reference (old ref → `Old References/`) or save to the Other folder. Uploads are staged client-side with preview thumbnails + pending badges and only commit when the admin presses **Update Turtle**. Multiple replace candidates of the same type show a warning and the last one wins; earlier ones are demoted to `Other …/`.
- **Historical photo viewer**: New `OldTurtlePhotosSection` above the additional photos section. Renders a date dropdown populated from the backend's `history_dates` aggregation (unique sorted dates across `additional_images/YYYY-MM-DD/`, `plastron/Old References`, `plastron/Other Plastrons`, `carapace/Old References`, `carapace/Other Carapaces`, legacy `loose_images/`). Selecting a date filters thumbnails to that day and labels each with its source (`Old Plastron Ref`, `Other Carapace`, etc.).
- **EXIF date extraction + filename date stamping**: New `_extract_exif_date` helper (Pillow `DateTimeOriginal`, falling back through `DateTimeDigitized` / `DateTime`). Every new file written to a turtle folder gets a `_YYYY-MM-DD` suffix stamped into its filename, preferring the EXIF "when taken" date over the upload date. `GET /api/turtles/images` now exposes `exif_date` / `upload_date` per entry and sorts `history_dates` using the EXIF-first priority so bulk-ingested archival photos group by when they were *taken*, not when the server ingested them.
- **Enhanced `GET /api/turtles/images` response**: Adds `primary_carapace` (path to the carapace reference, parallel to `primary`), structured `loose` entries as `{path, source, timestamp, exif_date, upload_date}` with `TurtleLooseSource` discriminant (`plastron_old_ref`, `plastron_other`, `carapace_old_ref`, `carapace_other`, `loose_legacy`), and `history_dates: string[]`.
- **`POST /api/turtles/replace-reference` endpoint**: Direct reference replacement for existing turtles (admin only). Form: `turtle_id`, `photo_type` (`plastron` | `carapace`), `file`, optional `sheet_name`. Wraps new public methods `TurtleManager.replace_plastron_reference` / `replace_carapace_reference` / `replace_turtle_reference`, extracted from `_approve_review_packet_locked`. Full atomic swap: staged `_staged_{op_ts}` copies, SuperPoint feature extraction, promote-then-evict, VRAM cache incremental update. Guarded by `_approval_lock`.
- **Cross-check carapace on admin match page**: A carapace cross-check button appears on `AdminTurtleMatchPage` whenever the packet has a carapace additional image. On click, runs `POST /api/review-queue/<id>/cross-check` with `image_path`, renders the top 5 carapace matches side-by-side with the plastron matches. A "Top match differs" warning badge appears when the top carapace match disagrees with the top plastron match.
- **Flash-drive ingest to new folder structure**: `ingest_flash_drive()` creates `plastron/` / `carapace/` subfolders (based on `_detect_photo_type(filename)` routing), generates the full subfolder tree up front, and uses biology-ID-prepended turtle folder names (`F001_K14`) to avoid collisions.
- **`normalize_ingest.py` script**: Cleans up the on-disk Rebuild Ingest folder — zero-pads biology IDs (`F65` → `F065`), strips messy prefixes (`F445 4-18-2025 VS Lab carapace.JPG` → `F445 Carapace.JPG`), and keeps a single canonical file per (bio ID, photo type). Dry-run by default, `--apply` to execute.
- **`TurtleImageAdditional` / `TurtleLooseImage` / `TurtleLooseSource`** exported from `frontend/src/services/api/turtle.ts` for strongly-typed consumers of the new response shape.
- **Generalized Sheets Browser staging pipeline**: The Sheets Browser turtle detail panel now stages *every* photo-type button (Microhabitat, Condition, Carapace, Plastron, Additional) into the same "Pending photos (uncommitted)" box — previously only plastron and carapace went through staging. All other types went straight to the server. Nothing commits until the admin presses **Update Turtle**. The staging state was widened (`StagedType`/`ReferenceType`) and a type guard `isReferenceType` centralizes the "does this type even allow reference replacement?" check. Plastron / Carapace still prompt for **replace current reference?** — other types stage directly. The pending box also reserves a marked slot for the tag UI coming with the `main` merge (tag chosen in the pending box → backend rename on commit).
- **`AdditionalImagesSection` prop generalized**: `onStageReferencePhoto?: (type: 'carapace' | 'plastron', file) => void` replaced with `onStagePhoto?: (type: 'microhabitat' | 'condition' | 'carapace' | 'plastron' | 'additional', file) => void`. When provided, every upload button routes through staging; when omitted, immediate packet/turtle upload behaviour is preserved (backward-compatible).
- **Photo management on the Create New Turtle flow**: Both the inline Create New Turtle modal on `AdminTurtleMatchPage` and the standalone `CreateNewTurtleModal` in `AdminTurtleRecords` now embed `AdditionalImagesSection` (titled **Photos for this upload**) between the Primary ID block and the Google Sheets data form, so admins can add or remove Microhabitat / Condition / Carapace / Additional photos at creation time instead of discovering the omission post-approval.
- **`primary_info` / `primary_carapace_info` in `GET /api/turtles/images` response**: A new `_build_primary_info(path)` helper on the backend returns `{path, timestamp, exif_date, upload_date}` for each of the active plastron and carapace references. `history_dates` now folds in these dates (EXIF preferred, upload fallback) so a turtle whose only 2022 photo is the primary plastron now surfaces `2022` in the date picker. The legacy bare-string `primary` / `primary_carapace` fields are preserved for backward compatibility.
- **`OldTurtlePhotosSection` renders active references under their capture date**: The section now accepts optional `primaryInfo` / `primaryCarapaceInfo` props. When the selected date matches a primary's EXIF / upload / file timestamp, the primary is shown in the grid with label **Plastron (active)** / **Carapace (active)**.
- **Candidate cards show chosen turtle name + Primary ID on the admin match page**: Plastron and carapace top-5 candidate cards now render the turtle's chosen **name** from Google Sheets and the auto-generated **Primary ID** (only shown when distinct from the on-disk biology id, to avoid duplicate labels for the common case where the folder *is* the biology id). Per-candidate `(primary_id, name)` is fetched in parallel via `/api/sheets/turtle/<id>` after the match list resolves; reads only, no Sheets writes. Keyed by `(turtle_id, location)` because biology IDs are not globally unique. `Community_Uploads/<tab>` paths route to the community spreadsheet via the existing `state` arg.
- **Folder-name backfill wired into the daily chronodrop**: `scripts/daily-backup.sh` now runs `backfill_folder_names.py --apply` between the Sheets export and the data backup, so the on-disk turtle folder structure picks up gender corrections (juvenile→adult, misgender renames), primary-ID rehoming, and `{bio_id}_{primary_id}` renames automatically against whatever the Sheets currently say. The backfill remains read-only against Sheets — only disk paths are touched. The wrapper restarts the backend container **only when the backfill actually applied changes** (exit code 2), so the VRAM cache reloads with the new file paths; no-op nights skip the restart entirely. `backfill_folder_names.py` exit-code contract is now documented: `0` = nothing to do, `1` = errors (chronodrop continues so the day is not lost), `2` = changes applied. Cron schedule remains **03:00 server time**. Documented in `docs/BACKUP.md`.
- **Admin-page backup countdown overlay**: New `BackupCountdownOverlay` mounts once at the App root and is gated to `staff` / `admin` users. Three states driven by the new `GET /api/backup/window` endpoint (the server is the source of truth for the absolute window timestamp — client clock drift / timezone shifts cannot skew it): **idle** (no UI), **countdown** (T-5min → T-0, bottom-right floating orange badge with mm:ss "Server backup in X:XX — please save your work"), and **maintenance** (T-0 onward, full-screen un-dismissable Mantine `<Modal>` blocking interaction; polls `/api/health` every 5s, dismisses automatically once the backend is healthy *and* we are past the expected duration so the modal does not flap during the restart). After dismissing, the overlay refetches the window for tomorrow's run. After 10 minutes of stalled maintenance the modal surfaces a contact-admin hint. Schedule is configurable on the backend via `BACKUP_SCHEDULE_HOUR` / `BACKUP_SCHEDULE_MINUTE` / `BACKUP_DURATION_SECONDS` env vars (defaults: 03:00 server-local, 8 minutes).
- **Inline keypoint extraction in `ingest_rebuild_folder.py`**: The Rebuild Ingest pipeline now generates `.pt` SuperPoint tensors inline by default — every newly-placed reference image (and any migrated `ref_data/` image lacking a `.pt`) gets its sibling tensor before the script exits. New `--no-extract` flag opts out for filesystem-only smoke tests; default extracts when `--apply` is set. New helpers `_extract_reference_pt(image_path, brain, ...)` and `_extract_missing_for_turtle(turtle_dir, ref_stem, brain, ...)` — a single end-of-handler pass walks both `plastron/` and `carapace/` for any reference image lacking a sibling `.pt` and runs `brain.process_and_save` inline. Failures downgrade to `reporter.warn` so one bad image doesn't abort the whole run. Closes a silent gap where new carapace images dropped by ingest had no `.pt` and stayed invisible to matching after backend restart, despite older docstrings claiming startup would fill them in. Recommended workflow is now `docker compose stop backend` → `ingest_rebuild_folder.py --apply` → `backfill_folder_names.py --apply` → `docker compose start backend`; the stop/start avoids loading two SuperPoint copies on a single GPU.
- **Symmetric dual-reference subdir layout in `ingest_rebuild_folder.py`**: Every turtle the script touches now receives the full `plastron/` + `plastron/Old References/` + `plastron/Other Plastrons/` + `carapace/` + `carapace/Old References/` + `carapace/Other Carapaces/` tree, regardless of whether this ingest provides plastron files, carapace files, or both. Empty subdirs stay empty until manually populated, so a carapace-only turtle can later receive a plastron via the admin UI without any folder-creation logic. New `TURTLE_REFERENCE_SUBDIRS` constant + `_ensure_full_subdirs(turtle_dir, reporter, apply)` helper called once per turtle in `_handle_turtle` after the new/existing branch resolves. Replaces the prior asymmetric behavior (carapace-only new turtles got no `plastron/` placeholder).

### Changed

- **Folder layout migration**: `ref_data/` → `plastron/`, `loose_images/` → `plastron/Other Plastrons/`. Legacy paths are still read (backwards-compatible fallback), but new writes always use the new layout. `refresh_database_index`, `_recover_staged_files`, `get_locations`, `_process_single_turtle`, `add_additional_images_to_turtle`, `add_observation_to_turtle`, and `_approve_review_packet_locked` all updated.
- **Admin upload is always plastron**: Removed the photo-type selector from `AdminTurtleMatchPage` — the admin's primary photo is always the plastron; carapace is uploaded via the additional-images button. Community uploads arrive as `unclassified` and `photo_type` is decided in the review queue classify step.
- **Biology IDs zero-padded to 3 digits**: `F002` / `M010` / `J025` is the canonical form. Turtle folder names are now `BiologyID_PrimaryKey` (e.g. `F001_K14`) so biology IDs reused across sheets don't collide on disk. Google Sheets being updated to match; backend `_parse_bio_id` handles both padded and legacy forms on read.
- **Additional images section renamed**: The shared `AdditionalImagesSection` title in the Google Sheets browser changes from "Turtle photos (Microhabitat / Condition) - {date}" to just **Additional Turtle Photos**. All add buttons unified to the default red theme (dropped the earlier `teal` and `grape` colors on carapace/plastron buttons).
- **Review queue community flow**: Unclassified community uploads now show three buttons — **Proceed with matching** (carapace), **Cross-check with plastron** (when a plastron additional image exists, runs both searches and displays them side-by-side with a "Top match differs" warning), and **Delete**.
- **Incremental VRAM cache updates**: Replace / approve operations no longer rebuild the entire index. `brain.add_single_to_vram()` and per-attr cache eviction keep latency flat as the dataset grows.
- **Crash recovery**: `_recover_staged_files` now scans `plastron/`, `ref_data/` (legacy), and `carapace/` for orphaned `_staged_*` files on startup and promotes any that survived an interrupted reference-replacement operation.
- **Replace-reference controls moved on admin match page**: The **Replace plastron reference with this upload** and **Replace carapace reference (first carapace photo)** checkboxes (plus their warning Alerts) moved out of the bottom action-buttons panel into a dedicated Paper placed directly under the **Additional Photos** panel. The decision and the photos it affects are now co-located; the bottom panel only holds Cancel / Save / Create-New-Turtle-Instead actions.
- **"Additional Turtle Photos" pane on Sheets Browser shows only today's uploads**: Previously filtered by the most-recent date folder seen on disk, so on a day with no new uploads it kept surfacing yesterday's (or older) photos. Now it uses today's local date (matching the backend's `time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` localtime folder naming), and the pane resets to just the upload buttons each new day. All prior uploads remain visible in **View Old Turtle Photos**.
- **`GET /api/turtles/images` and `POST /api/turtles/images/primaries` accept a `primary_id` fallback**: When the on-disk turtle folder still carries the original Primary ID (e.g. `T177…`) after the sheet's biology id (e.g. `F042`) was assigned/changed, lookups by biology id missed the folder. Both endpoints now retry the walk with `primary_id` if the primary `turtle_id` lookup returns nothing. Frontend `getTurtleImages` and `getTurtlePrimariesBatch` plumb the optional id; `SheetsBrowserTab` passes `selectedTurtle.primary_id` and the per-row `primary_id`. Serves as a safety net until the folder-rename chronodrop hook lands.
- **Create New Turtle modal starts fully editable**: Fields no longer require per-field click-to-unlock when *creating* a brand-new turtle on the admin match page. The lock-and-unlock behavior is preserved for *edit* mode. (`useTurtleSheetsDataForm.isFieldModeRestricted` now gated on `mode === 'edit'`.)
- **Home upload "Other" button → "Additional"**: The extras button on `PreviewCard` was labelled **Other** and staged with `type: 'other'`, but the per-type review filter only enumerated the 5 first-class kinds — so files chosen via that button staged invisibly. Renamed to **Additional**, staging type set to `additional`, with `'additional'` added to the `UploadExtraFile` type union and the backend `VALID_ADDITIONAL_TYPES` set so manifests preserve what the user picked.
- **Removed duplicate Carapace upload button on the home upload page**: An admin/staff-gated Carapace `<Button>` left over from an earlier refactor on `PreviewCard` was rendering a second Carapace alongside the main one.
- **Admin match page now shows the turtle's chosen name on each candidate card and in the comparison panel, and pulls Bio ID / Primary ID / Name from their actual Sheets columns instead of the folder name**: candidate cards moved the chosen Sheets `name` (column L) from below the turtle id to the top row alongside the rank badge so the name is the first thing the eye lands on; the comparison panel that opens when you click a match was rebuilt to a five-column grid `Bio ID | Name | Location | Confidence | Primary ID` with `Bio ID` (Sheets column C) and `Primary ID` (column B) now displayed separately. New `lookupIdFromTurtleId` helper splits the canonical combined-name folder form (`{bio}_{primary}`) before calling `/api/sheets/turtle/<id>` so the lookup actually finds the row — pre-fix, passing the combined string `F002_T1771234567` matched neither the Primary ID column nor the ID column on the backend, so the candidate summaries effect and `handleSelectMatch` both silently returned no data and the comparison view fell back to displaying the folder basename in both Bio ID and Primary ID slots. Helper prefers the primary-id-like segment (`T<digits>`, globally unique) and falls back to the bio-id-like segment (`[FMJU]\d+`).

### Fixed

- **Carapace additional images routed to `additional_images/` by mistake**: The approve-packet merge block was copying carapace entries into the turtle's `additional_images/` folder alongside microhabitat/condition photos. Now the merge block skips type `carapace` / `plastron` entries; the subsequent reference-processing block routes the first carapace to the reference (or replaces it with `replace_carapace_reference=True`) and any 2nd+ carapaces to `carapace/Other Carapaces/`. Same fix applied to `plastron`.
- **Superseded replacement candidates were lost**: When multiple plastron (or carapace) replace-reference uploads were staged on the Sheets Browser and committed, only the last one became the new reference and the earlier ones used to silently disappear. They now route to `Other Plastrons` / `Other Carapaces` with a warning chip on the staged preview so nothing is lost.
- **`add_additional_images_to_turtle` routed everything to `additional_images/`**: Now types `plastron` / `carapace` are redirected to `plastron/Other Plastrons/` or `carapace/Other Carapaces/`. Only microhabitat/condition/additional/other still land in the date-stamped `additional_images/` tree.
- **Sheets Browser turtle showed empty Old Photos viewer + "No identifier image yet"**: When a turtle's biology id was assigned/changed in the sheet after the on-disk folder was created (rename chronodrop hook still pending), the lookup walked by the new id and missed the folder named after the original Primary ID. Backend lookups now retry with `primary_id` as a fallback (see Changed → image endpoints).
- **Frontend `tsc` build broken by post-merge `SheetsBrowserTab` rename**: Several callsites still referenced the pre-merge `turtleId` / `sheetName` locals after `main` introduced `diskTurtleId` / `dataPathHint`; production build failed. All callsites updated and the dead `groupAdditionalByDateFolder` helper plus its now-orphaned imports (`TurtleImageAdditional`, `formatSingleDateTokenToUs`) removed.
- **Misleading docstring/README claims that backend startup extracts missing `.pt` files**: `refresh_database_index()` (in `turtle_manager.py`) only INDEXES existing `.pt` files — collects them into `db_index` and pushes both VRAM caches. It does NOT generate them from images. Pre-fix, `ingest_rebuild_folder.py`'s top docstring and `backend/README.md`'s "Suggested order" both told operators that a backend restart would fill in missing tensors after ingest, leading to silently unmatched turtles. Documentation corrected; actual extraction now runs inline during ingest (see Added). The `turtle_manager.py:485` docstring still references the legacy `ref_data/` scan and will be cleaned up alongside the broader ref_data fallback removal once production has been migrated.
- **Tag glued to active reference instead of moving to Old References on replace**: `replace_turtle_reference` was looking up the old active reference with a hard-coded lowercase-extension loop (`for ext in ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png']`). On Windows, `os.path.exists` matched case-insensitively against the actual `.JPG` file, so the loop succeeded but `old_img_path` carried the lowercase form. That string was then handed to `migrate_labels_to_archive`, whose manifest lookup is case-sensitive — silently no-op'd, leaving the source manifest's tag entry behind for the new file (which lands at the same path) to inherit. Replaced the loop with `os.listdir(ref_dir)` so we keep the real on-disk filename case. The identifier-plastron flow already used the case-safe `_find_image_in_dir` helper and was unaffected.
- **Active reference image showed stale bytes after a replace**: `getImageUrl` returned the same URL string before and after a replace (active reference paths are stable across replacements), so the browser cache served the previously-fetched bytes even though the data fetch had updated state. `GET /api/turtles/images` and `POST /api/turtles/images/primaries` now expose a finer-grained `upload_ts` / `primary_ts` (epoch ms — preferred from the embedded ms in archive filenames, falls back to `os.path.getmtime`), and `getImageUrl(path, version?)` appends `&v=<version>` when provided. Sidebar thumbnails, identifier preview, scratchpad, and Old Photos gallery + lightbox thread the timestamp through.
- **Old Photos "newest upload first" buried today's freshly archived plastrons below older actives**: Sort granularity was YYYY-MM-DD only — every photo uploaded today tied on the date-string slice and JS's stable sort preserved `allPhotos` build order, so `Plastron (active)` + `Carapace (active)` + microhabitat + condition always sat above the nine plastron archives uploaded seconds earlier. The visible-photo sort comparator in `OldTurtlePhotosSection.tsx` now prefers the new `upload_ts` ms tiebreaker in upload modes; date-string compare remains the fallback when one of the two photos lacks a timestamp. Date subtitles still slice to `YYYY-MM-DD` — no time-of-day surfaces in the UI.
- **Sheets browser "Photo tags" search ignored every manifest outside `additional_images/`**: `search_additional_images_by_label` walked the data tree but only scanned `<turtle>/additional_images/manifest.json` and its date subdirs, so any tag on a plastron / carapace active reference, an `Old References/` archive, an `Other Plastrons/` / `Other Carapaces/` extra, or a legacy `loose_images/` photo was invisible to the tag search — only microhabitat / condition / additional photos surfaced. Rewritten to walk every `manifest.json` under each turtle (skipping `Review_Queue/`, `benchmarks/`, and `Deleted/` subtrees), deriving `type` from the manifest's location (`plastron` / `plastron_old_ref` / `plastron_other` / `carapace` / `carapace_old_ref` / `carapace_other` / `loose_legacy`) and falling back to the entry's own `type` field for `additional_images/` so microhabitat / condition tags keep their existing badge labels. Response shape unchanged; no frontend update needed.
- **Review queue had no candidate-detail comparison view**: `AdminTurtleMatchPage` swaps in a Paper showing uploaded plastron + match plastron (and uploaded carapace + match carapace, when both exist) with a Back button when an admin clicks a candidate; `ReviewQueueTab` highlighted the selected card with a blue border but never showed a side-by-side compare. Mirrored the same pattern on `ReviewQueueTab.tsx` — clicking a candidate hides the matches grid and shows a compare Paper with `Back to matches` (`onItemSelect(selectedItem)` clears the selection), Rank badge, primary-photo pair, and (when an uploaded cross-photo exists) a dashed-divider cross-photo pair. Active-reference image URLs use the `upload_ts` cache-bust threaded in earlier so a freshly-replaced match reference shows the new bytes immediately.
- **Inline scratchpad tagging in `AdditionalImagesSection` dropped `primary_id` on the way to the labels endpoint**: the lightbox tag editor (in `OldTurtlePhotosSection`) already passed `primary_id` to the backend, but the small per-thumbnail `TagsInput` autosave called `setTurtleImageLabels(turtleId, path, tags, sheetName)` with only four args. When the on-disk folder didn't match the sheet's biology id (stray pre-rename folder, or biology id reassigned without the chronodrop having run yet), the bio-id-only walk on the backend missed the folder and tagging failed with "Turtle folder not found." Added a `primaryId?` prop to `AdditionalImagesSection` and threaded it through the inline-tag and staged-upload calls; `SheetsBrowserTab` now passes `selectedPrimaryId`. Lightbox flow unchanged. Other call sites (review queue, match page, create-new-turtle modal) keep the default `null` — they can opt in later.
- **Digital flag / physical_flag / collected_to_lab on admin uploads silently disappeared on approval**: the admin upload path in `routes/upload.py` extracted these fields from the multipart form into local variables but only persisted `photo_type` (and optionally `match_sheet`) into the packet's `metadata.json`, so the form values were lost the moment the route returned; the community upload path was already saving them via `user_info`. Admin packet metadata writes now persist `digital_flag_lat/lon/source`, `physical_flag`, `collected_to_lab`, and `location_hint_*` the same way community uploads do. Combined with the approval-side fallback below, the Release page now shows admin-uploaded flagged turtles after approval.
- **Approval flow dropped flag/find data because the frontend never sent it back**: `_approve_review_packet_locked` only wrote `find_metadata.json` to the turtle directory when the caller passed a `find_metadata` dict, but the two production approve calls in `useAdminTurtleRecords.tsx` (`handleSaveAndApprove`, `handleConfirmNewTurtle`) only sent `match_turtle_id` / `new_turtle_id` / `photo_type` / `sheets_data` — `find_metadata` was always None. Added `_extract_find_metadata_from_packet` that reads the packet's `metadata.json` and pulls the `digital_flag_*`, `physical_flag`, `collected_to_lab`, `microhabitat_uploaded`, `other_angles_uploaded`, and `location_hint_*` fields. Approval now uses this as a fallback when no `find_metadata` was passed; caller-supplied data still wins for any future flow that wants to override.
- **`get_turtles_with_flags` skipped the entire `Community_Uploads/` subtree**: when an admin approved a community upload as a brand-new turtle (without re-classifying it into a state folder), the turtle landed at `Community_Uploads/<sheet>/<turtle_id>/` along with its `find_metadata.json` — but the flag scan excluded that directory, so those turtles never appeared on the Release page. Now skips only `Review_Queue/`; `Community_Uploads/` is walked the same as any other state directory.
- **Scratchpad role-grouped headers all collapsed to "Other" after the main merge**: the merge from `origin/main` brought in a shared `frontend/src/constants/additionalPhotoKinds.ts` and rewired `AdditionalImagesSection.tsx` to label the "Saved photos" sections with `additionalPhotoKindLabel(k)`, which only knows the eleven canonical kinds and silently collapses anything outside that set (including this branch's seven scratchpad-only role variants — `plastron_active`, `plastron_old_ref`, `plastron_other`, `carapace_active`, `carapace_old_ref`, `carapace_other`, `loose_legacy`) to `"Other"`. Visible result: every active reference / old reference / other plastron / loose-legacy section all rendered with a "Other" header. Switched the header back to the local `kindSectionLabel(k)` (which has explicit cases for the role variants and falls through to the canonical helper for everything else); `byKind` likewise routes through the local `normalizeKind` so the role-suffixed kinds match their TYPE_ORDER entries instead of normalising to `'other'`.
- **`StagedType` on `SheetsBrowserTab.tsx` was the pre-merge five-value union (`microhabitat | condition | carapace | plastron | additional`)**: the new category buttons (anterior / posterior / left-side / right-side / people / injury) flowed through to `handleStagePhoto` via TypeScript bivariance, which meant runtime worked but `strictFunctionTypes` would surface the mismatch. Widened `StagedType` to the constants module's `AdditionalPhotoKind` and dropped the legacy `'additional'` literal (which the backend already aliases to `'other'`).
- **Scratchpad inline-tag autosave only saved when the user pressed Enter before clicking out**: the previous attempt relied on Mantine v8's `acceptValueOnBlur` calling `onChange` *before* our `onBlur` prop ran, which it doesn't reliably do — typed-but-not-Entered text was lost on blur, and the autosave saw the pre-typed tag list. Reworked to control the input via `searchValue` / `onSearchChange`, mirror both the committed tags and the pending typed text into synchronous refs, and merge them in `onBlur` before calling `saveInlineTags(img, merged)`. Mantine's blur behaviour is no longer load-bearing.

### Changed (post-main-merge polish)

- **`Plastron (additional)` button label simplified to `Plastron`**: the canonical-plastron button on `AdditionalImagesSection` now reads `Plastron`. The role-suffixed `plastron_other` section header (loose plastron extras living in `plastron/Other Plastrons/`) keeps its `"Plastron (additional)"` label so it stays distinguishable from the active reference. The accompanying description text is updated to "The Plastron button keeps an extra underside shot…".
- **Old Photos viewer category labels normalized through `additionalPhotoKindLabel`**: the auto-discovered category dropdown options and per-photo card badges now go through the constants helper, so `'left-side'` reads as **Left side** (not the prior simple-capitalize `Left-side`) and any future kind addition picks up its label automatically. The label for additional photos is also imported from the helper rather than the raw type string.

### Removed

- **"Add to specific turtle" direct-add mode on the HomePage**: The SegmentedControl toggle, cascading Sheet → General Location → Turtle dropdowns, and the `target_turtle_id` / `target_location` upload path are all gone. The same workflow lives in the Google Sheets Browser now where the turtle context is already established. `HomePage.tsx`, `usePhotoUpload.tsx`, `turtle.ts` (`uploadTurtlePhoto` signature, `UploadPhotoResponse` interface), and `backend/routes/upload.py` all simplified.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_carapace_support.py`**: Dual VRAM cache behaviour, `refresh_database_index` scanning both plastron and carapace folders, `_process_single_turtle` folder structure for both photo types, `search_for_matches` photo-type routing, `create_review_packet` unclassified flow, `approve_review_packet` with carapace. Updated for the new `plastron/` folder layout.
- **`tests/test_crash_recovery.py`**: Atomic reference replacement (plastron + carapace), staged file recovery from `_recover_staged_files`, VRAM cache eviction after a replace, temp file cleanup in the upload folder. Updated assertions now check `plastron/Old References/Archived_Master_*` for archived masters.
- **`tests/test_vram_cache_updates.py`**: `add_single_to_vram`, incremental updates after approve/replace, ingest refresh skip logic.
- **`tests/e2e/admin-match.spec.ts`**: Two new specs — (1) Create New Turtle modal exposes `AdditionalImagesSection` with Microhabitat / Condition / Carapace / Additional upload buttons; (2) `Replace plastron reference` checkbox renders *above* the `Save to Sheets & Confirm Match` button (placement check via `compareDocumentPosition`), guarding against a regression where it gets pushed back into the bottom action panel.
- **E2E assertion alignment after the `main` merge**: `admin-records.spec.ts:96/185` and `admin-match.spec.ts:562` updated for the renamed section heading (`"Microhabitat / Condition photos"` → `"Additional Photos"`/`"Additional Turtle Photos"`); strict-mode fixed with `{ exact: true }` so the heading does not collide with the empty-state copy. `admin-records.spec.ts:52` (Webkit/Mobile Safari flake) hardened with the same `Promise.race` settle-wait used by test 75 so the count check no longer races the queue panel's fetch. `admin-match.spec.ts:636-639` switched from `getByRole('button', …)` to `getByText` to match Mantine `<Button component="label">` which renders as `<label>`, not `<button>`.

### Merged from main (1.2.20–1.2.22)

- **Photo-category expansion** (PR #180): adopted main's six new
  canonical categories — `anterior`, `posterior`, `left-side`,
  `right-side`, `people`, `injury` — alongside `carapace`, `plastron`,
  `microhabitat`, `condition`, and `other`. The Sheets Browser
  scratchpad shows all eleven as upload buttons, the per-row Type
  Select on staged photos uses the same canonical list, and the Photo-
  tags search panel's category Select filters by them too. Backend
  routes accept any of these via `parse_additional_type_filter` /
  `normalize_additional_type` (legacy `head`/`tail`/`additional` map
  to `anterior`/`posterior`/`other`). Replaces the home-page
  "Additional" button with per-category buttons; existing manifests
  with `type: 'additional'` display under "Other".
- **Drag-and-drop on category buttons**: `UploadTypeButton` lets users
  drop image files directly onto a category instead of clicking. Wired
  into the Sheets Browser scratchpad and the home upload page.
- **`getImageUrl` options object**: `getImageUrl(path, { version,
  maxDim })` now combines our cache-bust suffix with main's server-
  side downscaled JPEG previews (`?max_dim=N`, 32–2048 longest edge).
  Backward-compatible — existing positional `getImageUrl(path,
  version)` callers unchanged.
- **`max_dim` JPEG previews**: `GET /api/images?path=…&max_dim=N`
  returns a Pillow-resized JPEG (EXIF-transposed, mode-normalized,
  Lanczos resample). Passed through admin thumbnails (sidebar 240px,
  match cards 560px, primary preview 320px, scratchpad 160px) so
  large images don't blow up the page weight.
- **Primary-thumbnail loader**: Sheets Browser sidebar shows a
  spinner while `getTurtlePrimariesBatch` is in flight; clears stale
  thumbnails when the filter changes.
- **Footer About / Contact / Feedback** (PR #172): new `/feedback`
  route, `POST /api/contact` (SMTP via `CONTACT_FORM_RECIPIENTS`), and
  `POST /api/feedback` (GitHub Issues via `GITHUB_FEEDBACK_*` env vars).
  Auth-backend hardened with shared in-memory IP-window rate limiter;
  optional JWT lets logged-in feedback submissions include account
  identity on the issue.
- **Auth `localhost` retry**: when `AUTH_URL` uses `localhost` and the
  validation request fails on a connectivity error, the backend
  retries once against `127.0.0.1` (Windows / dev-host quirks).
- **Flask error handler returns JSON**: `HTTPException` (404, 405,
  etc.) is handled before the generic `Exception` handler so client
  errors keep their proper status code and `error` body instead of
  being remapped to 500.
- **Behavior change** (home upload): every user — including community
  — now sees buttons for all eleven canonical categories. Previously
  Carapace was admin-only and Plastron was community-only on the home
  page; consolidated for consistency with the unified-kinds intent.

---

## [1.2.22] - 2026-04-29 — Sheets browser plastron thumbnail loading state

### Changed

- **Sheets browser** (records list): While primary plastron paths are loading from **`getTurtlePrimariesBatch`**, each row shows a **spinner** in the thumbnail slot instead of the empty photo placeholder. When loading finishes, the slot shows either the **preview image** or the **placeholder** (no identifier plastron on disk), so loading vs. missing image is unambiguous. Stale thumbnails from a previous filter are cleared when a new batch starts.

## [1.2.21] - 2026-04-29 — Image previews, Flask HTTP errors, proxy routing docs

### Added

- **`GET /api/images`**: Optional **`max_dim`** query parameter (32–2048, longest edge in pixels) returns a server-generated JPEG preview when the original is larger; transparent/palette images flattened to RGB; HEIF/HEIC supported via existing Pillow registration.
- **`getImageUrl`** (`frontend/src/services/api/turtle.ts`): Optional **`GetImageUrlOptions.maxDim`** appends **`max_dim`** for downscaled URLs (clamped to the same range as the API).

### Fixed

- **Flask** (`backend/app.py`): Handle **`HTTPException`** (404, 405, etc.) before the generic **`Exception`** handler so client errors keep the correct status and JSON **`error`** body instead of being treated as **500**.

### Changed

- **`.env.docker.example`**: Clarify reverse-proxy routing — send **`/api/auth`**, **`/api/admin`**, **`/api/contact`**, **`/api/feedback`** (and auth-backend **`/api/health`**) to the Node auth service; route remaining **`/api/*`** to Flask — with longest/specific paths first so contact and feedback are not handled by Flask by mistake.
- **Admin UI** (additional images, Review Queue, Sheets browser): Image **`src`** uses scaled previews where sizes are bounded (e.g. thumbnails vs. lightbox still uses full **`getImageUrl`** where wired); **`loading="lazy"`** and **`decoding="async"`** on those **`<Image>`** elements.

## [1.2.20] - 2026-04-29 — Footer & contact, GitHub feedback, extended turtle photos

### Added

- **About & Contact in the footer** (Washburn-focused copy); staff/admin drawer breakpoint adjusted. Contact uses **`POST /api/contact`** on the auth-backend (**`CONTACT_FORM_RECIPIENTS`**, SMTP, Reply-To visitor); Washburn links remain as fallback where applicable.
- **`/feedback`** with **`POST /api/feedback`**: creates GitHub issues (REST); optional Projects v2 link and status via GraphQL; labels from **`GITHUB_FEEDBACK_LABELS`** plus type labels. Env documented in **`.env.docker.example`**.
- **Turtle photo categories** (homepage, Sheets browser, Review Queue, Match): anterior, posterior, left/right side, people, injury, plus existing types; filenames encode category (e.g. `right-side_…`). **Drag-and-drop** onto category buttons to stage photos (homepage and admin).
- **Sheets browser**: optional photo category filter; **`GET /api/turtles/images/search-labels`** supports tag-only, category-only, or combined queries (`q` and/or `type`, at least one required).

### Changed

- **`EmailVerificationGuard`**: **`/feedback`** allowed before email verification (same as About/Contact).
- **`.gitignore`**: **`project-query.graphql`** (local GraphQL helpers).
- **Legacy labels**: `head` / `tail` no longer shown as buttons; stored values still map to **anterior** / **posterior**.
- **Review queue** additional-image uploads use the same category set as turtle records.
- **Admin token validation**: if **`AUTH_URL`** uses `localhost` and validation fails, one retry against **`127.0.0.1`** (Windows/dev hostname quirks).

### Testing

- Playwright: footer nav including Feedback; Sheets browser type-only search; homepage categories and drag-and-drop (mobile/WebKit skipped where unreliable).
- Backend: **`search-labels`** filters; **`right-side`** on review packet additional images.

## [1.2.19] - 2026-04-27 — Mobile tutorial viewport + Specific Property label and Location reminder

### Fixed

- **UI polish**: Inline **external-link** icons, clearer **Contact** CTA, automatic footer height (`311444d`).
- **First-visit mobile tutorial viewport**: Fixed a mobile rendering issue where opening the instructions tutorial on a fresh device could initially render the app in desktop-like scale. Mobile media queries now resolve on initial render for home/tutorial flow, and tutorial scroll height uses dynamic viewport sizing for more stable phone layout.

### Changed

- Renamed the Google Sheets column label **Specific Location** to **Specific Property** across the WebApp form and backend sheet column mapping.
- Added reminder text to the **Location** field (Column S) in the WebApp form: enter who first found the turtle.
- Updated the related sheet-column mapping test to validate **Specific Property** ordering before **General Location**.

## [1.2.18] - 2026-04-24 — Review approve research/community sync guard + match-form General Location unlock

### Fixed

- **Review approve — research match**: Confirming a match to an **admin/research** turtle no longer writes or updates the **community** Google Sheet. Admin and community spreadsheets stay separate; only **community → admin** moves still delete the row from the community sheet (`match_from_community`). Resolves unwanted extra rows (e.g. #150).
- **Admin Turtle Match — General Location**: On the match sheet form, **General Location** was hard read-only (plain text + “Add new General Location” only, no catalog dropdown). It is now in the same **Unlock editing** flow as other editable match columns; after confirm, the **catalog select** works like elsewhere. Sheets with a **fixed catalog default** (`generalLocationLocked`) still show a disabled control **without** an extra unlock step.

### Testing

- **`backend/tests/test_review_approve_no_community_sync_on_research_match.py`**: Unit tests (Flask test client + mocks) assert that approving a **research-only** match does not call `get_community_sheets_service`, and that **community → admin** approval still calls `delete_turtle_data` only (no community create/update).
- **Playwright** (`frontend/tests/e2e/admin-match.spec.ts`): **Edit matched research turtle** asserts General Location starts locked with **Unlock editing**, then offers catalog options including **West Topeka** after unlock.

## [1.2.17] - 2026-04-21 — Sheets browser biology ID for disk images + primaries batch

### Fixed

- **Admin Sheets browser — identifier plastron and thumbnails**: Image APIs (`GET /api/turtles/images`, batch primaries, identifier upload, additional photos) now use **`turtleDiskFolderId`**: the sheet **ID** (biology folder name, e.g. **`F439`**) when present, then **Primary ID** (`T177…`). On-disk layout is almost always **`data/…/<biology id>/ref_data/`**; sending Primary ID first left **`primary: null`** and empty previews even when `F439.JPG` / `F439.pt` existed.
- **Batch primaries map**: Response rows are applied **in request order** with stable **`turtleKey`** (includes optional **`row_index`** from `/api/sheets/turtles`) so list thumbnails do not mis-assign or overwrite when many turtles load at once.
- **Photo tags → sheet row**: `findTurtleForMatch` matches **`m.turtle_id`** against **either** biology **`id`** or **`primary_id`**.
- **`TurtleSheetsDataForm`**: Dynamic field values are coerced to **strings** so numeric **`row_index`** on list payloads does not break `TurtleFormField` (`string | number`).

### Changed

- **Sheets browser identifier panel**: Removed the redundant **orange** general/location warning; short guidance remains in the muted help text. **Search** in the turtle list also matches **Primary ID**.

## [1.2.16] - 2026-04-23 — Sheets folder resolution (primary path + state/site layout)

### Fixed

- **`_get_turtle_folder` / Sheets primary thumbnails**: If `data/<sheet_name hint>/<turtle_id>/` existed as an empty (or weak) folder while the real turtle data lived deeper (e.g. `data/Kansas/Topeka/T42`), the API returned **`primary: null`** and the UI showed **Set identifier** for everyone. Resolution now scores **`ref_data`** (`.pt` / reference image) across all matching folders and picks the strongest match instead of trusting the hinted path alone.
- **Sheets browser vs disk layout (Kansas etc.)**: The spreadsheet tab name (`sheet_name`, e.g. `Kansas`) is not the same as the filesystem path when turtles live under **`data/Kansas/<site>/<biology id>/`**. The Sheets UI now passes **`general_location` + `location`** as the folder hint (same idea as review queue `state/location`). **`resolve_turtle_dir_for_sheet_upload`** resolves **`State/turtle_id`** by scanning **`State/<site>/turtle_id`**, and **does not** auto-create **`data/State/<new primary id>/`** when the state directory already has site-style subfolders (prevents stray `Kansas/T177…/` trees).

## [1.2.15] - 2026-04-22 — Primary ID sync before nightly Sheets backup

### Changed

- **`python -m backup.run`** (used by **`scripts/daily-backup.sh`**): Before exporting CSV/JSON, runs the same **Primary ID migration** as backend startup for the **admin** and **community** spreadsheets when needed (biology **ID** present, **Primary ID** empty). Nightly backups therefore include complete Primary IDs without restarting the API container.

## [1.2.14] - 2026-04-22 — Sheets plastron workflows (identifier uploads, additional plastron)

### Added

- **Sheets browser — plastron workflows**: Set a first-time identifier plastron for sheet-only turtles (creates `data/<location>/<turtle_id>/` when needed), replace the existing SuperPoint reference (old master archived to `loose_images`), or upload an **extra** underside photo as **Plastron (additional)** in the manifest (does not create or replace `.pt`). New admin API **`POST /api/turtles/images/identifier-plastron`** (`turtle_id`, `file`, `mode`: `set_if_missing` | `replace`, optional `sheet_name`). Additional-image type **`plastron`** is allowed server-side. **`POST /api/turtles/images/additional`** now creates the turtle folder from `sheet_name` when it was missing (same resolver), so microhabitat uploads work for new rows too.

### Testing

- **`backend/tests/test_turtle_plastron_upload.py`**: folder resolution, first identifier, set-if-missing conflict, replace archives old master, additional upload creates folder (brain `process_and_save` mocked to write a dummy `.pt`); **`test_get_turtle_folder_prefers_real_ref_data_over_empty_hint`**; **`test_resolve_finds_nested_when_hint_is_state_only`** / **`test_resolve_no_shallow_folder_when_state_has_site_layout`** for state-only hints vs nested layout.

## [1.2.13] - 2026-04-20 — Review queue candidate filenames with uppercase extensions

### Fixed

- **`GET /api/review-queue` HTTP 500** when a packet’s `candidate_matches` images use an uppercase extension (e.g. **`Rank1_IDT42_Conf85.JPG`**). Parsing stripped only lowercase `.jpg`/`.png`/`.jpeg`, so `Conf`/`Rank` segments still contained **`.JPG`** and `int()` raised **`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '85.JPG'`**. **`format_review_packet_item`** now removes the extension with **`os.path.splitext`** and a case-insensitive suffix check before splitting on **`_`**.

### Testing

- **`backend/tests/test_review_packet_format.py`**: **`test_candidate_uppercase_jpg_extension_parsed`** asserts **`Rank1_IDT42_Conf85.JPG`** yields the same rank, turtle id, and confidence as the lowercase **`.jpg`** case.

## [1.2.12] - 2026-04-20 — Upload favorites, extra photo tags, admin Sheets browser

### Added

- **Home match-scope favorites (staff)**: Star locations (including “All locations”) in the upload scope `Select`; favorites are grouped (“Favorites” / “More locations”), default scope respects saved order after reload (waits for `GET /locations` before locking selection). Preferences sync to **`GET`/`PUT /api/auth/user-ui-preferences`** (SQLite table `user_ui_preferences` in auth-backend) when logged in, with **localStorage** fallback and one-time migration from cache if the profile is empty.
- **Additional turtle photos**: Optional **tags** on extra images (manifest); types **carapace**, **condition**, **microhabitat**, and **other**; admin APIs `GET /api/turtles/images/search-labels` and `PATCH /api/turtles/images/additional-labels`; integration tests in `test_turtles_routes.py`.
- **Admin UI**: Staged upload with per-image type and tags; inline tag editing on saved photos (turtle folders); **Sheets browser** “Photo tags” mode with grouped results and larger previews; home/upload flow sends tagged extras via `extra_*` + `extra_labels_*`.

### Changed

- **CORS**: `PATCH` included in allowed methods for cross-origin tag updates.
- **Upload route**: Shared `_collect_extra_upload_files` parses `extra_carapace_*`, `extra_other_*`, and per-index labels.
- **Turtle additional photos**: POST stores `original_filename`; when images are merged into turtle folders, the stored file name uses the upload’s original basename instead of only the temp path. Integration test for review-queue carapace + labels; HTTP test client supports `PATCH`.

## [1.2.11] - 2026-04-18 — Biology ID parsing with trailing sheet notes

### Fixed

- **Max biology ID when the ID cell includes extra text**: Only values matching a strict “letter + digits only” pattern were counted toward the highest numeric suffix. Real sheet cells often append notes (e.g. **`J666 (UT1 4/13/2026)`**, **`M637 (UT 713 …)`**), so those rows were skipped and the next ID could be far too low (e.g. **637** while **666** already existed). **`get_max_biology_id_number`** now treats every **M/F/J/U** + digits token in the cell (and a leading ID before spaces or parentheses) so the shared sequence advances correctly (e.g. **U667** after **J666**). **`normalize_biology_id_display`** strips the same leading ID for canonical **MFJU** + three-digit form.

### Testing

- **`backend/tests/test_sheets_sparse_column_regression.py`**: Cases where **J666** appears with a **(UT …)** suffix; **`generate_biology_id`** yields **U667**.
- **`backend/tests/test_value_normalize_and_biology.py`**: Parametrised normalize cases for annotated IDs.

## [1.2.10] - 2026-04-18 — Google Sheets sparse-column reads (new turtle row / max biology ID)

### Fixed

- **Google Sheets new-turtle row / biology ID scan (sparse columns)**: Reading only column **A** (or only the biology **ID** column) for `values.get` can omit rows where that cell is empty but another column in the same row has data. That made `create_turtle_data` compute too small a `next_row` and **overwrite an existing turtle row**, and `get_max_biology_id_number` miss high IDs (e.g. **J666**) so the next ID was too low (e.g. **U637** instead of **U667**). **Append** now uses a range spanning **Primary ID through ID**; **max biology suffix** is scanned from **column A through the ID column** (`A2:…` for the max scan so the header row is not parsed as an ID).

### Testing

- **`backend/tests/fakes/google_sheets_api_fake.py`**: Fake `spreadsheets.values` that models sparse **single-column** `values.get` (rows omitted when that column is empty). Used to assert **behaviour** (which sheet row is written; max biology suffix / next U-ID), not only range strings.
- **`backend/tests/test_sheets_sparse_column_regression.py`**: Behavioural regression for the admin “new turtle” chat bug — **no overwrite** of an existing row when Primary ID is missing on some lines; **J666 → next U667** (and documents **U637** as max-stuck-at-636). Reverting the `crud`/`migration` fixes should fail these tests; E2E against real Google Sheets is not required for this class of bug.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-04-17 — Backup dates follow host TZ; daily-backup invokes data script with bash

### Changed

- **Backup folder dates (`sheets/…/YYYY-MM-DD/`, `data/…/YYYY-MM-DD/`)**: `scripts/daily-backup.sh` sets **`BACKUP_DATE`** from the host (`date +%Y-%m-%d`) and passes it into `python -m backup.run` so Sheets exports match the same calendar day as `backup-backend-data.sh`. **`scripts/backup-backend-data.sh`** uses the host local date by default (no longer UTC-only). **`backend/backup/run.py`** reads optional env **`BACKUP_DATE`**; otherwise uses `datetime.now()` in the container.
- **`scripts/daily-backup.sh`**: Calls **`bash`** on `backup-backend-data.sh` so the data backup runs without the execute bit on `.sh` files.

## [1.2.8] - 2026-04-16 - Host data/ backups + daily backup scripts

### Added

- **Host backup of backend `data/` (Docker volume)**: `scripts/backup-backend-data.sh` copies `/app/data` from the running backend (or from the `backend-data` volume if the container is down) to `BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR/data/YYYY-MM-DD/` on the host. `scripts/daily-backup.sh` runs `python -m backup.run` (Sheets CSV/JSON) then the data copy so one cron job covers spreadsheets and images. Documented in **docs/BACKUP.md** and **backend/README.md** (combined `crontab` example with `COMPOSE_DIR` / `BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR`).

### CI

- **CUDA requirements parity**: `backend/scripts/check_requirements_cuda_sync.py` ensures `requirements-docker-cuda.txt` lists every pip package from `requirements.txt` except `torch` and `torchvision` (installed separately in `Dockerfile.cuda`). Covered by `backend/tests/test_requirements_cuda_sync.py`; wired as job `cuda-requirements-sync` in **Backend Integration Tests**.
- **Production GPU image smoke**: Job `backend-cuda-image-smoke` builds `backend/Dockerfile.cuda` (GitHub Actions cache for Docker layers) and runs `python3 -c "import app"` inside the image so missing dependencies and import-time crashes in the same stack as production deploy surface before merge. Runs in parallel with the existing integration job after the sync check; Playwright/E2E Compose still uses the CPU `Dockerfile`, so this closes the Dockerfile.cuda gap.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-04-16 - Add pillow-heif to CUDA image and libheif runtime deps

### Fixed

- **GPU backend crash on startup (production)**: `Dockerfile.cuda` installs only `backend/requirements-docker-cuda.txt`, which did not include `pillow-heif` after HEIC support landed in `requirements.txt`. `app.py` imports upload routes → `image_utils` → `pillow_heif` at startup, so the container exited with `ModuleNotFoundError` and the API never stayed up. Added `pillow-heif>=0.16.0` to `requirements-docker-cuda.txt`. Installed **`libheif1`** and **`libde265-0`** via `apt` in `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.cuda` so the HEIF stack has runtime libraries inside the image (no host-level installs required).

## [1.2.6] - 2026-04-15 — HEIC uploads + case-insensitive image lookup

### Fixed

- **Match thumbnails missing for `.JPG` references (Linux)**: Reference images saved with uppercase extensions (e.g. `F128.JPG`) were not resolving on the production Linux server because `convert_pt_to_image_path` and the related candidate-copy / replace-reference paths hard-coded a lowercase extension list (`['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png']`) combined with `os.path.exists`. Case-sensitive filesystems silently returned the raw `.pt` path, which the frontend then couldn't render. Added case-insensitive helpers `routes.upload.find_image_for_pt`, `turtle_manager._find_image_next_to_pt`, and `turtle_manager._find_image_in_dir` that scan the containing directory and match the file stem against any supported image extension regardless of case. Windows/NTFS was never affected because its filesystem is case-insensitive.
- **HEIC upload failures without EXIF**: `image_utils.normalize_to_jpeg` previously passed `img.info.get('exif', b'')` to Pillow's JPEG encoder, but some HEIC files store `'exif'` mapped to `None` rather than omitting the key, bypassing the default and crashing the encoder with `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. Guarded so `exif=` is only passed to `save()` when actual bytes are present.

### Added

- **HEIC/HEIF upload support**: iPhone photos arrive as HEIC by default and Chrome/Firefox cannot render HEIC natively. New `backend/image_utils.py` registers `pillow-heif` at import time and exposes `normalize_to_jpeg()`, which is a no-op for non-HEIC inputs and otherwise converts in-place to a sibling `.jpg` (quality 95, EXIF preserved — including `DateTimeOriginal` for future history-date aggregation — EXIF rotation applied). Called immediately after every `file.save()` in `routes/upload.py`, `routes/review.py`, and `routes/turtles.py` (5 call sites). `heic`/`heif` added to `config.ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`; `pillow-heif>=0.16.0` added to `backend/requirements.txt`. Frontend `fileValidation.ts` accepts `image/heic` / `image/heif` with an extension fallback (Chrome/Firefox leave `file.type` blank for HEIC), `HomePage.tsx` Dropzone accept list and user-facing "Supported formats" text updated to include HEIC.

### Testing

- **`backend/tests/test_image_lookup.py` (32 tests)**: Regression coverage for the case-insensitive lookup. Parametrised across `.jpg`/`.JPG`/`.jpeg`/`.JPEG`/`.png`/`.PNG`/`.Jpg`/`.JPg` against all three helpers, plus passthrough / missing-sibling / missing-directory / unrelated-file / alias contract cases.
- **`backend/tests/test_image_utils.py` (13 tests)**: HEIC normalization coverage. Generates HEIC fixtures programmatically via pillow-heif's bundled encoder to exercise real encode → decode round-trips. Verifies sibling `.jpg` creation, original-file deletion, uppercase `.HEIC` / `.heif` handling, EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` preservation, and multi-tag EXIF round-trip.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-04-13 — Admin offline backup URL (Flask vs Express)

### Fixed

- **Admin offline backup (ZIP)**: Endpoint moved from `GET /api/admin/backup/archive` to `GET /api/backup/archive`. The Express auth backend mounts `/api/admin/*`, so requests to the old path never reached Flask and returned **404** in production; the download handler remains admin-only on Flask.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-04-13 — PyTorch cu128 for NVIDIA Blackwell (RTX 5080 / sm_120)

### Fixed

- **RTX 50-series (Blackwell, sm_120)**: Official cu121 wheels only ship GPU archs through **sm_90**, so PyTorch warned and could misbehave on e.g. RTX 5080. CUDA backend image is now **`nvidia/cuda:12.8.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04`** with **torch / torchvision from `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`** (**torch ≥ 2.7**, **torchvision ≥ 0.22**) so sm_120 is supported.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-13 — GPU visible to PyTorch (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES)

### Fixed

- **`docker-compose.gpu.yml`**: Removed default `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all`. That variable is **not** the same as `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: CUDA expects numeric GPU indices (`0`, `1`, …). The value `all` is invalid for `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and commonly yields `torch.cuda.is_available() == False` even with a correct CUDA PyTorch build (`torch.version.cuda` still set). Optional pin via `.env` only (e.g. `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`).
- **GPU reservation**: Added `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` (NVIDIA, `capabilities: [gpu]`) alongside `gpus: all` for Compose setups where device requests need the explicit block.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-13 — CUDA PyTorch not overwritten by pip; clearer GPU diagnostics

### Fixed

- **CUDA PyTorch after `pip install -r`**: `kornia` and other deps can pull `torch` from PyPI and replace the cu121 wheels with a **CPU-only** build. `Dockerfile.cuda` now force-reinstalls `torch` / `torchvision` from the PyTorch CUDA index after all other packages and fails the image build if `torch.version.cuda` is unset.
- **Compose GPU env**: `docker-compose.gpu.yml` sets `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES` so the NVIDIA Container Toolkit passes driver capabilities into the backend container.

### Changed

- **Logs when GPU missing**: `TurtleBrain` logs `torch.__version__` and `torch.version.cuda` to distinguish “CPU-only wheel in image” vs “CUDA build but no device / toolkit”.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-13 — Production GPU deploy (CUDA PyTorch + Compose)

### Fixed

- **Production deploy uses GPU stack**: GitHub Release deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy-release.yml`) now runs `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up --build -d` so the backend image is built from `Dockerfile.cuda` and receives `gpus: all`. Previously the workflow only used the default Compose file, which builds the CPU-only backend (`Dockerfile`).
- **CUDA image installs PyTorch with CUDA**: `backend/Dockerfile.cuda` installs `torch` / `torchvision` from the PyTorch CUDA 12.1 wheel index (`cu121`); remaining dependencies use `backend/requirements-docker-cuda.txt` so pip does not pull CPU-only PyPI wheels. Added `python-is-python3` for healthchecks that invoke `python`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-13 — PicTur branding, US date fields, admin ZIP backup, favicon

### Added

- **Favicon & attribution**: Turtle favicon (`frontend/public/favicon.png`) with `rel="icon"` and `apple-touch-icon` in `index.html`; global footer with Freepik / Flaticon links and a link to the icon asset for compliance.
- **Admin offline backup (ZIP)**: `GET /api/admin/backup/archive` (`scope=all` or `scope=sheet&sheet=…`) returns a ZIP of `data/` plus Google Sheets CSV/JSON exports (admin-only, not staff). **Google Sheets Browser** adds “Offline backup (ZIP)” (full archive or current tab). Client: `downloadAdminBackupArchive`, `isAdminRole`.

### Changed

- **Branding & document title**: App and docs use **PicTur** (renamed from TurtleTracker / Turtle Project); npm packages `picturfrontend`, `pictur-auth-backend`; example paths `pictur`; GitHub repo [`Lxkasmehl/PicTur`](https://github.com/Lxkasmehl/PicTur). Default browser tab title **PicTur**.
- **Frontend dates**: Turtle date fields in Google Sheets forms (first found, last assay, dates refound, transmitter/radio/iButton, etc.) normalize to **MM/DD/YYYY** on load and before save; placeholders match. Photo card/modal timestamps use US date + 12-hour time (not `toLocaleString()`). Sheets browser titles for microhabitat/condition photos use US folder dates.

### Fixed

- **PhotoCard**: Removed unused `onPhotoClick` prop (ESLint).
- **Dates refound**: Space-separated refound dates (e.g. two ISO dates without commas) normalize every value to US format; previously only the first date was kept on load/save.

### Testing

- Playwright: `tests/e2e/us-date-format.spec.ts` — Turtle Match fields show **MM/DD/YYYY** when the mocked sheet API returns ISO date strings.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-05 — Observer hub, backups, mortality tooling, and SQLite auth

### Added

- **Google Sheets backup**: `python -m backup.run` exports admin and community spreadsheets to CSV/JSON under `BACKUP_OUTPUT_DIR` (default `./backups`); Docker documents a host mount; see `docs/BACKUP.md`.
- **Observer gamification**: Observer Hub with XP, quests, badges, and rewards for logged-in users; state in SQLite (`community_game`) with `GET`/`PUT /auth/community-game`, Redux on the client and local fallback when sync fails.
- **Deceased turtles**: `Deceased?` column and sheet styling; APIs to mark deceased without plastron ID (`mark-deceased`, lookup options); staff UI on home and turtle forms.
- **Review queue**: `match_search_pending` and UI for in-progress SuperPoint matching (no misleading “0 matches”); faster list polling while any item is pending.
- **Deploy on GitHub Release**: Workflow checks out the release tag over SSH and runs `docker compose up --build -d` (`.github/workflows/deploy-release.yml`; secrets and `DEPLOY_PATH` documented in repo).
- **Auth tooling**: `npm run delete-user` in auth-backend (by email; refuses removing the last admin).

### Changed

- **Auth storage**: Primary store is SQLite (`auth.sqlite`, `better-sqlite3`) with one-time import from legacy `auth.json`; WAL, foreign keys, and `email_verifications.used_at` when missing. Google signup handles verification timestamps and duplicate SQLite `UNIQUE` errors cleanly.
- **Auth behavior**: JWTs are rejected with 403 if the user row no longer exists. Unverified users may use `/observer` (other areas still require verification).
- **Community general location**: Optional free text in community flows (review queue, new turtle); research paths keep the catalog dropdown. Community sheet tabs do not use research catalog validation on that column (including clearing validation after row writes).
- **Research sheet schema**: Canonical column order and exact headers for new tabs (frequency, DNA, cow interactions, flesh flies, morphometrics, etc.); wider read ranges; biology ID parsing/normalization for display and generation. Admin turtle form and Turtle Match follow the same layout; Pit/archive/adoption/iButton/cow/flesh fields are free text; `value_normalize` applies only to the biology ID column.
- **General locations & Drive**: Default Kansas list and `DRIVE_LOCATION_TO_BACKEND_PATH` updates.
- **`reset_complete_backend.py`**: Removes leftover Django DB/media paths instead of clearing via the old ORM.

### Fixed

- **Community game**: Progress persists to local storage when server sync fails; cache clears only after a successful round-trip.
- **Legacy auth import**: Missing `email_verified` in imported JSON treated as verified with sensible `email_verified_at` backfill.

### Testing

- Playwright and pytest coverage expanded for review-queue pending state, Observer HQ and gamification, community general location in create flow, and community-game API behavior.

### Removed

- Legacy Django app under `backend/turtles/` (Flask-only API; `image_processing.py` for SuperPoint/LightGlue retained).
- Deprecated VLAD/FAISS helpers (`search_utils.py`, duplicate `vlad_utils` modules); direct `faiss-cpu` and explicit `scipy` dropped from `requirements.txt` (transitive installs may still apply).
- Unused Flask imports in `app.py`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-23 — End-to-end stack: matching, general locations, and ops polish

### Added

- **General locations**: State-dependent catalog in admin turtle forms (dropdown + add-new), sheet-specific defaults, and Google Sheets validation on new tabs.
- **Docker**: `docker-compose.gpu.yml` and `scripts/docker-up.ps1` / `docker-up.sh` (prefer GPU, fall back to CPU).

### Fixed

- **Catalog & Sheets**: Safer `general_locations.json` handling (no placeholder injection; POST add-location does not persist fake keys; first-run seed matches repo); `POST /api/general-locations` applies dropdown rules via the real Sheets client; research turtle create/update re-syncs the affected tab.
- **Search & staff upload**: Normalized location filters aligned with the cached index; match-scope select always shows a valid option when stored values are missing from loaded data.

### Changed

- **Matching**: SuperPoint/LightGlue outputs (`score`, `confidence`) consistent across backend, admin, and GUI; LightGlue pinned to `v0.2`; SIFT paths removed; VLAD/FAISS left as deprecated compatibility-only.
- **Admin & uploads**: Sheet/location changes clear and remount General Location to avoid stale Mantine labels; clearer upload instructions (layout, plastron checklist, lab vs field note, closable reminder, “View instructions” header).
- **Review queue**: Safer packet IDs and staged reference-image replacement so failed feature extraction does not wipe existing reference data.
- **CI (Playwright E2E)**: Smoke run, parallel `--shard` matrix on `tests/e2e`, shared `e2e-playwright-prepare` action, `e2e-success` gate, HTML reports per smoke/shard (browser matrix unchanged); `bash -n` and `shellcheck` on Docker launchers (Linux).

### Removed

- Unused root `package.json` (frontend remains the npm entry point).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-14 — Sheet/location hierarchy, community spreadsheets, and verified accounts

### Added

- **Location hierarchy (sheet + location)**: New turtles and community uploads use a two-level selection (e.g. sheet Kansas → location Wichita). Backend paths: `data/<sheet>/<location>/<turtle_id>/`. New locations can be added under an existing sheet without a new Google Sheet tab. Resolves #96.
- **Post-confirmation automation**: After confirming an upload (match or new turtle), the backend relabels photos with the confirmed turtle ID and syncs to a community-facing Google Spreadsheet. Configure `GOOGLE_SHEETS_COMMUNITY_SPREADSHEET_ID` in backend `.env`. Resolves #73.
- **Email verification & password policy**: New users (email/password) must verify their email via signup link (`POST /auth/verify-email`, `POST /auth/resend-verification`). Google OAuth users count as verified; admin routes require verified email. Registration and change-password enforce policy via `validatePassword`; new endpoint `POST /auth/change-password` (authenticated). Shared email helpers for verification, admin promotion, and invitations; sender configurable via `SMTP_FROM`.
- **Docker**: Frontend port configurable via `FRONTEND_PORT` (default 80). For port 80 conflicts use `FRONTEND_PORT=8080` and `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080`. See `.env.docker.example`.
- **Review queue & community sheets**: Badges for "Admin upload" vs "Community upload"; sheet/location dropdown respects `sheetSource`. API: `GET /api/sheets/community-sheets`; sheets/turtle endpoints accept `target_spreadsheet: 'community'`. Option "+ Create New Sheet" for community turtles (creates tab and `data/Community_Uploads/<name>`). Backend layout: `data/<admin sheet>`, `data/Community_Uploads/<community sheet>`.
- **Community turtle → admin**: When matching a community turtle to the research spreadsheet, flow selects admin sheet + location, creates turtle row, moves folder to `data/<State>/<Location>/`, and removes from community sheet. Match search includes selected location, all community turtles, and incidental finds.
- **Flash-drive ingest**: Configurable ingest routing maps drive folder names to backend destinations (`State/Location`) without renaming source folders. Supports flat and hierarchical layouts; explicit state-level folder handling for `data/<State>/...` imports.
- **Match scope**: With a location selected, match search runs against that location plus all Community_Uploads and Incidental_Finds. Home page options: "Community Turtles only" (Community_Uploads only) or "All locations" (everything). Helper text describes the three scope behaviors.

### Changed

- **Auth**: DB migration adds `email_verified` / `email_verified_at`; existing users treated as verified. JWT and `/auth/me` include `email_verified`. E2E test setup marks test users verified.
- **Intake survey**: "Health Status" field with free-text and optional tooltip (mucous, eyes, shell, dehydration, mites, etc.); stored in Sheets when column exists.
- **Turtle forms & locations**: ID field always read-only (create and edit); copy clarifies IDs may not be unique across sheets. General Location required for admin turtles; paths `data/State/Location/PrimaryID`. `get_all_locations()` includes state-level folders so sheet-based states appear in dropdowns. Review queue: admin `new_location` = Sheet/general_location; community = single sheet in community spreadsheet.
- **Create New Turtle / Sheet–Location**: Sheet/Location dropdown shows only top-level states (e.g. Kansas); Kansas sublocations (e.g. Kansas/Wichita) and system folders (Community_Uploads, Review_Queue, Incidental_Finds) are no longer selectable. In backend-location mode, Kansas expands to location entries; selecting `Kansas/<location>` keeps Sheets tab at state level while targeting backend path at location level. `LOCATION_SYSTEM_FOLDERS` and `SYSTEM_FOLDERS` include Incidental_Finds.
- **Admin upload match scope**: Home page "Which location to test against?" supports location-level options in `State/Location` format; Kansas expands to locations, other states remain state-level.
- **CI (Playwright)**: E2E runs smoke tests (auth, navigation, upload) first, then remaining E2E; Playwright report artifact uploaded only on failure.

### Fixed

- **Google Sheets**: Single RLock for all Sheets API use and reinit to avoid concurrent SSL errors and segfaults (e.g. DECRYPTION_FAILED_OR_BAD_RECORD_MAC, exit 139).
- **Create New Turtle E2E**: ID field now populates on WebKit/Firefox (request biology ID when sex selected; test mocks `/api/locations` and waits for generate-id).
- **E2E flakiness**: Sex dropdown scoped to listbox; longer timeout for "From this upload"; review queue content and "No pending reviews" timeouts (WebKit, Mobile Safari).
- **Community sheet creation**: "Create New Sheet" for community turtles no longer creates the tab in the research spreadsheet; generate-id and update-turtle accept `target_spreadsheet`; frontend passes it when `sheetSource` is community.
- **E2E and test setup**: Test user seed scripts always update password and role for existing users so E2E credentials work regardless of prior state. Playwright webServer uses `path`/`cwd` and `127.0.0.1`; Vite `strictPort: true`. Login fixtures use `noWaitAfter`, detect login errors, and throw clear messages suggesting `npm run test:setup`. Selectors: `getByRole('textbox')` for Sheet/Location, regex for General Location; ID field always disabled; sheet option selection uses exact match (Kansas vs Kansas/Wichita).
- **New turtle create UX**: In-progress/success notification updates and short post-success delay before redirect so completion feedback remains visible. Removed duplicate primary-ID generation path in frontend create/confirm flow to reduce round-trips.

### Testing

- **E2E**: Review queue upload-source badges (Admin vs Community), community-turtle-move-to-admin flow (`data-testid` on badges). Create New Turtle duplicate-name tests mock `/api/locations` and fill General Location. Home page match-scope helper text and sheet dropdown (top-level states only, no sublocations/system folders). admin-community-to-admin and Create New Turtle support both Mantine Select and native `<select>` for Sheet/Location.
- **Integration**: Tests for `GET /api/locations` and for `POST /api/sheets/generate-id` with `target_spreadsheet` (research/community).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27 — First release: community turtle ID and review workflow

### Added

- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and Google OAuth via auth backend (Node.js/Express). JWT-based sessions and role-based access (admin vs community).
- **Photo upload and matching**: Admins and community users can upload turtle photos; system returns top matches. Community uploads go to a review queue for admin approval.
- **Admin features**: Review queue for community uploads with suggested matches; admin can confirm match or create new turtle. Photo upload with immediate top-5 match selection.
- **Turtle records / data**: Turtle data management with optional Google Sheets integration (service account); auto-generated biology IDs and configurable fields.
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) app with Mantine UI, Tailwind, Leaflet maps; configured for auth and PicTur API backends.
- **Backend**: Flask API (Python) for photo processing and matching; auth backend for user and session management.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose setup for frontend, auth-backend, and backend; persistent volumes for DB, uploads, and review state.
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests (Docker-based) and backend integration tests (pytest); CI workflows for main/develop.
- **Documentation**: README with quick start (Docker and local), functionality overview, and versioning guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
- Version control and release process: `CHANGELOG.md`, version in `frontend/package.json`, and guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
