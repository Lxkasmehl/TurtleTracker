# Changelog

All notable changes to TurtleTracker will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Docker**: Configurable frontend host port via `FRONTEND_PORT` in `.env` (default 80). When port 80 is in use, set `FRONTEND_PORT=8080` and `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080` so auth redirects work correctly. See `.env.docker.example` and comments in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Changed

- **Matching pipeline**: Admin and GUI match flows now use SuperPoint/LightGlue match outputs (`score`, `confidence`) consistently across backend and frontend.
- **Search filtering**: Fixed default and location-filtered matching in GUI/API by normalizing location filters and aligning filter labels with cached index locations.
- **Review safety**: Hardened review-packet processing with safer packet IDs and staged reference-image replacement to avoid losing existing reference data if feature extraction fails.
- **Dependencies**: Pinned LightGlue to `v0.2` for reproducible backend installs.
- **Legacy compatibility**: Removed remaining SIFT-based processing calls and marked VLAD/FAISS helpers as deprecated compatibility modules (non-default path).
- **Docker runtime UX**: Added GPU compose override (`docker-compose.gpu.yml`) plus cross-platform launchers (`scripts/docker-up.ps1`, `scripts/docker-up.sh`) that prefer GPU when available and fall back to CPU automatically.
- **CI hardening**: Added Linux launcher validation in GitHub Actions (`bash -n` + `shellcheck`) to keep Docker startup parity healthy across platforms.
- **Repository cleanup**: Removed unused root-level `package.json` to avoid confusion with the actual frontend package.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27

First release of TurtleTracker: a community-driven web platform for turtle population monitoring using image-based identification.

### Added

- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and Google OAuth via auth backend (Node.js/Express). JWT-based sessions and role-based access (admin vs community).
- **Photo upload and matching**: Admins and community users can upload turtle photos; system returns top matches. Community uploads go to a review queue for admin approval.
- **Admin features**: Review queue for community uploads with suggested matches; admin can confirm match or create new turtle. Photo upload with immediate top-5 match selection.
- **Turtle records / data**: Turtle data management with optional Google Sheets integration (service account); auto-generated biology IDs and configurable fields.
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) app with Mantine UI, Tailwind, Leaflet maps; configured for auth and turtle API backends.
- **Backend**: Flask API (Python) for photo processing and matching; auth backend for user and session management.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose setup for running frontend, auth-backend, and backend together; persistent volumes for DB, uploads, and review state.
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests (Docker-based) and backend integration tests (pytest); CI workflows for main/develop.
- **Documentation**: README with quick start (Docker and local), functionality overview, and versioning guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
- Version control and release process: `CHANGELOG.md`, version in `frontend/package.json`, and guide in `docs/VERSION_AND_RELEASES.md`.
